## Backstory:
%%
Charles is quite the unusual fellow, having been abandoned as a child he knew not what life outside of squalor was. Charles had to scrounge the streets for food, but once he grew older and bolder, he turned to stealing various goods and selling them for pocket money. However, it went wrong one day, he was captured, caught stealing a valuable mouse from a well known animal handler of [[Rosen Wheel]]  . This mouse ended up becoming Charles’ first friend.

This slaver’s name was Wilson [[Dulrayea!/Z_Pictures/2. Group Npcs art/2. Families/Buckstones/Buckstones]], a semi-famous breeder that supplied the [[Crimson Palisades]] with their Griffons they use as mounts for their guards. Charles didn’t think getting captured would be that bad, after all, he had slipped away multiple times from people far more threatening than this. However, he had heard rumors of brutal gladiatorial games hosted by him for the other family’s entertainment. These rumors, to Charles’ misfortune, were true.

This life was filled with bloody combat and extremely close calls, but he always came out on top eventually, and even gained the favor of his captor, because of Charles’ knack to make him laugh, or chortle, thus how he gained his name because Wilson thought that unfortunate humor was a fine choice as a name.

One day, during a game, Charles went up against a particularly strong opponent, nothing that he couldn’t take of course. He played around him making sure to get the crowd on his side with his mockery of this opponent. Eventually this opponent grew tired of the crowd’s laughter and swung his hammer at Charles, and it struck, it struck hard. Slammed to the floor, the enemy swung down on Charles, but in that moment Charles felt a surge of wild magic emanating from inside him.

It felt foreign but familiar all at once. In an instant he was transported to this strange forest, there he found a red demon with long black horns, he whispered to Charles, “I see you are in a bit of a predicament, your own hubris is to blame. However, I can grant you unfathomable power on one condition, you resurrect me from my grave.” Charles, seeing no other option, agreed to this and asked “where?” The demon before him said, “A caravan of travelers, you shall find, travel with them despite them being weak of mind, this is how you shall resurrect I, and as you seek, you will know when you will find I.” Charles then woke up a Warhammer above his head, and before he let out his hands to cast a spell he said “welp shit” and casts Encroaching Shadows. 

This spell was unknown to Charles, but he figured this gave him a chance to escape. And so he ran, surging with new power he knew not what held. He ran until he found an old wagon in an unmarked town he figured he could hideout in. When he awoke, he saw a group of travelers and a couple of scientists, and they all assumed you were hired already, so why not get some easy money? This group of outsiders found Charles after his recent escape, and he immediately knew this was the group, because they were rather stupid. His new power had saved him before, and will continue to, but for an adverse goal. A goal that if he ever decided to back out of, he would be immediately transported back to that strange forest, and sent to wander there, until some unfathomable being took over his mind, a fate worse than death

Eventually captured by the Crimson Palisade after a skull splitting ringing that compelled Charles to run from a recent bandit ambush encounter, Charles was interrogated alone, but he had nothing to hide so nothing happened. He was then held with the party of travelers he had rode with since. And as he was knocked out to be dragged to the king, he saw the red demon

Charles had seen this man in the past, when his initial surge of wild magic allowed him to break free from his certain death. This sight has brought him great dread, as he knew he was definitely being watched, and that if he ever faltered, we would be damned.

After his most recent evasions from death, Charles had learned much much more about his own powers, and the powers that could take them away extremely fast if they had no more use for him.

The first of that power is [[Ragmesh]], now, Charles has no clue who this god is, he just knows the sun with the eye in the sky doesn’t like him too much. After testing various things, such as conjuring a fire near [[CG3]], When this happened CG3 shadowed self appeared from thin air he named himself [[Revenant]], it burned a dark black flame, darker than that of even when he was talking with [[Magnus, The Forsaken]] in his head just months before. It surged bigger than the tiny speck seen before, showing the progression of how far along Charles had been taken to the void. This climaxed when Charles, being the thief he is, tried to steal CG3’s Revenants essence, he was successful, but when trying to get away, he misty stepped into this awful plane, one of the three sons sitting on his throne in front of him. Charles’ hand would not let go of the essence, black tendrils spurred up through his arm, a yellow eye began to appear, the rune on his hand began to spread and another arm appeared from it, he fell weaker and weaker and resorted to attempting to cut off his hand to get out, worms infected the vile wound. He felt a blessing, if you could call it that, from this tree god that got him out, the sun looked upon him and whispered “do not defy me.”

Charles knew these twisted gods were still alive, they had never controlled him in the past, but they had also saved him. And they prove time and time again, they will save him, but they won’t help him. What game were they playing with his life. 

Charles wished for this new power. This black flame that had only come when he had been under the control of some entity he knew not of which its name was. He felt this was just another magic he could add to his collection, another way to become free, but it was just the opposite, a firmer grip upon Charles’ life by the gods he had never sworn to, as signified by this cursed mark upon his left hand.
