For generations, they had traded in rare gemstones and precious metals, supplying the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in the kingdom with the finest treasures. Their reputation was one of honor and integrity. They were known for their unwavering commitment to quality, and their ability to source the most elusive and sought-after metals and gems. Many sought their advice and guidance, and the Stavros family was regarded as one of the most respected and trusted merchants in the realm.

>>   But all of this changed with "The Great Collapse Of Structure" A sudden and catastrophic drop in the value of certain precious metals left the Stavros family on the brink of bankruptcy.

The sudden shift in the market left him with no choice but to reassess their position. Desperate to maintain his family's wealth and position, Lanrick began to look for other, more secretive, and lucrative means of staying afloat.
