# **Hearty Breakfast Mechanic**

#### **Culinary Skill Check:**

> [!recite|background-blue] %%-%% **Skill Challenge:** Preparing a hearty breakfast requires a Cooking skill check, with the **DC** varying depending on the rarity of the ingredients used. A **fail** by 5 or more leads to a meal that causes indigestion, reducing all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws by -1 until a short rest is taken. A critical **fail** (rolling a **1**) results in severe digestive issues, imposing a -2 penalty that necessitates a long rest or medical treatment to overcome.

### **Effects Based on Ingredient Rarity:**

| Ingredient Rarity | Cooking DC | Bonus Effects                      |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Basic             | 10         | Standard **1d4** bonus.            |
| Common            | 12         | **1d4** bonus, +1 to all rolls.    |
| Uncommon          | 14         | **1d4** bonus, +2 to all rolls.    |
| Rare              | 16         | Substitute **1d4** with **1d6**.   |
| Very Rare         | 18         | Substitute **1d4** with **1d8**.   |
| Legendary         | 20         | Substitute **1d4** with **1d10**.  |
| Mythical          | 22         | Permanent +1 to one ability score. |
| Unique            | 24         | Substitute **1d4** with **1d12**.  |
| Artifact          | 26         | Substitute **1d4** with **1d20**.  |



##### **Morning Vigor Benefits:**

- **Fortifying Meal:** A successfully prepared breakfast grants a bonus **1d4** to add to all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until the next long rest. If a 4 is rolled on this **1d4**, any d20 roll between 16 and 19 is treated as a natural 20.

**Meal Preparation Requirements:**

- **Time and Ingredients:** Preparing a hearty breakfast takes a minimum of 45 minutes. The meal must include a protein source (such as meats or eggs), carbohydrates (like breads or grains), and fresh produce. The benefit level is influenced by the rarity of the ingredients.

**Chef Feat Benefits:**

- **Expertise Reduction:** Characters with the Chef feat reduce the **DC** of their Cooking checks by 2, aiding in the preparation of more complex meals. They may also automatically succeed on one Cooking check per long rest when using ingredients of Rare quality or lower.

**Proficiency with Cook’s Utensils:**

- **Utensil Mastery:** Characters proficient with cook’s utensils gain a +2 bonus on Cooking skill checks. This proficiency also allows for an additional +1 to any rolls affected by the breakfast's bonuses and extends these effects by one hour.

>>[! quote | clean] Nate F.
>>This system was inspired and created by using the rules from the [Battlezoo Bestiary](https://battlezoo.com/products/battlezoo-bestiary-for-d-d-5e). Credit goes to them for originally designing this system, I only refined it and made into a system that was more concise and hopefully less overwhelming to my players. Please support the creators.

# Refinement

>[!law | background-black color-blue]+ ## Refining
>> [!recite| wsmall right]+ Refinement Example
>> **PF2e** — *A fighter wants to refine a spear using monster parts from a recently defeated a group of Banshees. The fighter has 275 gp worth of Banshee parts. They start by building the spear for 1 gp, leaving them with 274 gp in parts. Using 250 gp, they refine the spear to item level 6, passing a **Refine DC 21** which grants a +1 item bonus to attack rolls, an extra damage die, and the ability to imbue an additional property. With 24 gp worth of parts remaining, the longsword is partially refined towards level 7, requiring 86 more gp worth of parts to reach the next level.*
>>
>
>> [!note | clean no-i ]+ ### How to use Parts
>> To refine items using monster parts, start by gathering parts equivalent to the item's standard creation cost (e.g., 1 gp for a spear). As you add more parts, the item levels up, providing benefits like increased attack rolls, additional damage dice, and imbuing capacity. Use provided tables to determine the total value of parts needed for each level, noting that items cannot exceed the character's level. Refining can be done quickly during daily preparations for fast-paced gameplay, or during downtime for a more crafting-centric approach.
>> 
>> Salvaging allows you to recover up to 50% of the parts used in a refined item, while transferring refinement or imbuing properties between similar items costs 10% of the difference in part values. This flexible system ensures that players can enhance their gear using monster parts, providing unique upgrades and customizations based on their adventures and the monsters they defeat.
>
>> [! note | clean no-i ]+ ### Harvesting Parts
>> The types of parts that can be harvested and refined fall into four categories, **Elemental**, **Esoteric**, **Visage**, and **Aspect**. *Elemental* and *Esoteric* parts will allow a character to refine their weapons and *Visage* and *Aspect* to refine armor, and other wearable items. However, the GM has final say in how harvested parts can be used, and which categories the parts can be used towards for gaining an [[#Augmentation]]. If the GM determines that parts can be harvested from the slain creature, roll 1d4 to see how many parts are harvest. Recommended to increase dice size by 1d4 per size after medium.
>> 
>>> [! recite |  left  wsmall]+ Harvest Example 
>>> **5e** — *The party has just slain a Hydra and harvests for parts. The GM rolls 2d4 for total parts harvested, rolling total of 4. The ranger wishes to attempt to retreive more, and makes a Survival check against a DC set by the GM. The ranger, passes and gains an additional 2 parts. Since the hydra is CR 8 the total bounty is 360 gp worth of hydra parts.*
>>
>> When harvesting parts, the character is automatically successful in harvesting the first time. They can attempt a second harvest using the appropriate skill to increase the total parts gained by 1d4 against a DC set by the GM.
>>> [! note | clean no-i]+ ### Refining DC checks
>>> Once a character has obtained parts they can begin the refining process. This can vary system to system, but a general rule to follow would be **15**+**Item Level** for Pathfinder 2e, and **10**+**Item Level** for Dungeons and Dragons 5e. Cost of failure is only 25% of the value used. It is up to the GM what skill is used to refine the item. Alternatively, a character can pay 50% of the cost of the item refining material in gold to have a NPC of equivalent skill make it with no failure.

# Augmentation
>[!item]+ ## Augments
>> [! note | clean no-i no-t] 
>> ### How to get an Augment
>> After an item has been refined to certain level within one of the four refinement categories, it will gain an Augment of the essence of the creatures and magic used to refine the item. Depending on your item category will depend on which Augments you gain.
>>
>> As stated before in [[#Refinement]] there are four Augmentation categories, and each have their own subcategories. The four main augments are, **Elemental**, **Esoteric**, **Visage**, and **Aspect**. With these once a certain level has been reached in Refinement, the item will become augmented and will gain a Augmentation as listed below.
>>
>> ### Choosing an Augment
>> Augments can vary depending on what the character is planning on using. For Weapons, the choice is broken down primarily by which Origin is used for Augmentation. The three Origins are, Arcane, Ravage, and Talent, and each have their own unique features.
>>
>> When a character has begun refining their item they must choose which Origin they wish to refine their weapon towards. When a refinement is destroyed or removed either by choice or by salvaging, the item loses the Augmentation it had previously gained.
>> 
>> ###  Multiple Origin Augments (Optional)
>> This is a variant rule that is up to the GM if they wish to allow. Multiple Origin Augments (**MoA**) allows for a character to augment their items with different Augments of different origins. While this can create unique combos and interesting effects this can lead to some possibly stronger characters.
>>
>>> [! recite | right wsmall] **MoA** Example
>>>  *A level 12 fighter can have a Greatsword with Arcane origin Level 2, Ravage origin level 6, and Talent Origin level 4, for a total Origin level of 12.*
>>
>> If this variant rule is used combos of all kinds can be used. A weapon can be refined to be augmented with both Fire and Ice, Sonic and Electricity, or Void and Radiant/Vitality. Even armor can benefit from this rule allowing for combination of unique magic armor.
