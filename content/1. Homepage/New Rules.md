### Arcane Overcharge Rules  ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/297337084660940810/1635c2888e06b2ea1be9d2ab0ab9f6fe.webp?size=80)    
***Purpose:*** These rules allow spellcasters to harness magical energies beyond their normal limits at great personal risk, introducing a mechanic where spellcasters can attempt to cast spells for which they do not have the appropriate spell slots or wish to cast at a higher level.
***Eligibility:***A spellcaster may only attempt an Arcane Overcharge with spells that are within their capacity to learn and cast, meaning the spell must be on their class’s spell list and they must have the theoretical ability to cast spells of that level. For instance, a wizard who can cast up to 3rd-level spells may attempt to overcharge only up to 3rd-level spells, not beyond.

***Arcane Check Difficulty Class Table:***

| Spell Level | Difficulty Class (DC) |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| 1           | 12                    |
| 2           | 14                    |
| 3           | 16                    |
| 4           | 18                    |
| 5           | 20                    |
| 6           | 22                    |
| 7           | 24                    |
| 8           | 26                    |
| 9           | 28                    |


##### Arcane Overcharge Procedure
**Initiating Overcharge:** 
- Spellcasters may attempt to channel more powerful magical energies than they currently command by initiating an Arcane Overcharge. This can occur when casting a spell from their known repertoire at a higher level than their available spell slots, or when lacking the appropriate spell slot altogether.

##### Backlash Damage
**General Rule:** 
- Upon initiating an Arcane Overcharge, the caster immediately suffers backlash damage. This damage is determined by the nature of the spell and its intended effect, serving as a consequence of drawing upon unstable magical energies.

***Specific Damage Types by School of Magic:***
1. **Evocation and Damaging Spells:**
   - The caster takes damage equal to half of the spell's maximum potential damage. For example, if an overcharged *Fireball* (normally dealing 8d6 damage) is attempted, the caster would take 24 points of fire damage as backlash.
2. **Conjuration Spells:**
   - For summoning spells, the backlash manifests as a shock to the caster’s system, dealing 2d8 psychic damage due to the strain of pulling creatures or objects from other planes or locations.
   - For teleportation spells like *Teleport* or *Misty Step*, the caster risks spatial disorientation, suffering 2d10 force damage as they momentarily lose connection to their physical form.
3. **Illusion and Enchantment Spells:**
   - The mental strain of manipulating reality or minds causes the caster to suffer psychic damage. This damage scales with the level of the spell: 1d6 psychic damage per level of the spell attempted. For instance, attempting to overcharge a *Phantasmal Killer* (a 4th-level spell) would cause 4d6 psychic damage.
4. **Utility Spells (including Divination, Abjuration, etc.):**
   - Utility spells that protect, reveal, or otherwise alter magical or physical properties cause exhaustion. The caster gains one level of exhaustion as their energy drains, reflecting the taxing nature of bending reality to their will without proper preparation.
5. **Necromancy Spells:**
   - Overcharging necromantic spells draws life force directly from the caster. They suffer necrotic damage amounting to half the spell’s level multiplied by 1d10. For example, an overcharged *Animate Dead* (a 3rd-level spell) results in 3d10 necrotic damage to the caster.
6. **Transmutation Spells:**
   - The instability of altering physical forms or properties leads to physical backlash, where the caster takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage due to sudden, jarring shifts in their own molecular structure or surroundings

> ##### *Additional Considerations:*
*- If a spell does not fit neatly into one of these categories or has multiple effects (such as a spell that damages and heals or a spell that conjures and causes damage), the Dungeon Master should combine effects appropriately or choose the dominant effect for determining backlash damage.*
  *- Backlash damage cannot be reduced or negated by any means, as it is a direct consequence of tapping into raw, uncontrollable magic.*

##### Overcharge Effects Roll
- Upon enduring the backlash damage, the caster rolls a d8 to determine the immediate, varied effects of their overcharged spell attempt. This expanded table includes specific consequences based on the spell type and situational outcomes:

1. **Spell Failure:** The magical energies completely dissipate. The spell has no effect, and any resources used (including components) are wasted.
2. **Severe Backlash:** The caster suffers the full potential damage of the spell, or if the spell has no damage component, another severe penalty occurs, such as a second level of exhaustion or loss of voice for verbal spells for 1d4 hours.
3. **Spell Reversal:** The spell’s effects are mirrored back at the caster. If it's a damage spell, the caster takes the intended damage. If it's a beneficial spell, its benefits apply to the nearest enemy.
4. **Randomized Effect:** The spell’s effect is correctly produced but occurs at an unintended location or affects an unintended target within range. The DM determines the new target or location randomly.
5. **Uncontrolled Surge:** The spell activates with an amplified or diminished effect, at the DM’s discretion. For example, a *Fireball* could cover a larger area at lower damage, or a *Healing Word* could either double the healing or only restore a single hit point.
6. **Temporal Distortion:** The spell effect is delayed by 1d4 rounds, manifesting unexpectedly at that later time. This could lead to strategic complications or unintended benefits.
7. **Elemental Confusion:** The spell's energy is converted into a different but related element or effect. For instance, a *Lightning Bolt* might instead release as a *Cone of Cold*, or a *Charm Person* might become a *Fear* spell affecting the same target.
8. **Successful Overcharge:** The spell functions as intended, executing perfectly at the increased level or despite the lack of a proper slot. This is the ideal outcome and demonstrates a masterful control of arcane forces under duress.

> ##### *Additional Mechanics:*
*- If the caster rolls a 1 or 2, they may choose to immediately attempt another Arcane Stability Check at a higher DC (+5 to the original DC) to mitigate the effect to a less severe but still negative outcome. Success modifies the roll to any number between 3 and 7, at the caster’s discretion.*
*- The effects of spells that have a range of "Self" are modified to affect the caster more intensely or in unexpected ways when rolling 3-7, due to the internalized nature of the spell energy.*

##### Consequences of Frequent Overcharging

***Incremental Effects:***
- **First Instance:** After the first overcharge beyond the safe limit (more than two overcharges between long rests), the caster experiences a surge of unstable energy. This results in immediate temporary side effects such as blurred vision, causing disadvantage on attack rolls and Perception checks for 1d4 hours.
- **Second Instance:** The second instance of overcharging in the same period increases the severity of backlash. The caster suffers a level of exhaustion and a minor arcane burn—a physical manifestation of magical overstrain that temporarily reduces the caster’s highest available spell slot by one level until a long rest is taken.
- **Third Instance:** Additional overcharging causes more profound disruptions in the caster’s magical conduit. They gain a second level of exhaustion, and the arcane burns become more severe, permanently reducing the capacity of one spell slot (DM’s choice which slot is affected) until cured through specific magical means such as a *Greater Restoration* spell or a similar powerful effect.

**Long-Term Consequences:**
- **Chronic Overcharger:** If a caster becomes a chronic overcharger (defined by the DM, typically overcharging more than five times in a week), they develop a condition known as Arcane Scarring. This manifests as a permanent reduction in one spell slot level and vulnerability to magical backlash, causing double backlash damage from any overcharge attempt.
- **Arcane Instability:** Repeated overcharging can lead to arcane instability, where spells randomly fluctuate in effectiveness. This could mean spells occasionally casting at one level higher or lower than intended without control or prediction by the caster.
- **Magical Dissonance:** The caster's frequent manipulation of the weave (the source of all magic in the universe) leads to a dissonance effect. This means any spell cast within 1d4 days of overcharging has a 10% chance to trigger a wild magic surge or an unintended magical effect as determined by the DM.

**Recovery and Cure:**
- **Restoration:** Recovery from the more severe effects of frequent overcharging requires significant downtime and specific magical treatment. Spells such as *Greater Restoration* may alleviate some symptoms, but often a quest to seek a more potent cure or ritual is necessary. 
- **Special Rituals:** DMs are encouraged to create quests or require players to seek out unique magical artifacts, ancient libraries, or sages that can provide deeper healing or reversal of the most severe consequences of arcane burns and scarring.
  

### Sanity Mechanics  ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/297337084660940810/1635c2888e06b2ea1be9d2ab0ab9f6fe.webp?size=80)    

- **Sanity Score:** Each character starts with a Sanity score of 10. This score fluctuates based on the character's experiences and mental state. _
- **Gaining Sanity Points:** Whenever a character fails a Sanity check, they gain 1 Sanity point. Increasing Sanity points represent a decline in mental stability.
- **Nighttime Sanity Checks:** Each night, characters must make a Sanity check with a DC of 11. If they fail, they gain 1 Sanity point due to nightmares or restless thoughts.

_**Effects of Sanity Points**_ The effects of accumulating Sanity points are tiered based on the number of points a character has:
 
##### Sanity Effects Table

| Sanity Points | Effect                 | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 11            | Mild Anxiety           | Minor sleep disturbances; -1 penalty to all Wisdom checks.                                                                                                             |
| 12            | Increased Irritability | Short temper; disadvantage on Charisma checks in social interactions.                                                                                                  |
| 13            | Paranoia               | Mistrusts others; disadvantage on all Insight checks and resistance to accepting help from allies.                                                                     |
| 14            | Hallucinations         | Begins to hear or see things that aren't there; disadvantage on Perception checks.                                                                                     |
| 15            | Phobia                 | Develops a phobia (e.g., darkness, heights); must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw when exposed.                                                                       |
| 16            | Obsessive Compulsions  | Obsessive Compulsions \| Must perform specific rituals; failing to do so results in being unable to focus (disadvantage on all Intelligence and Concentration checks). |
| 17            | Mania                  | Extreme shifts in mood and behavior; must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to avoid taking rash actions.                                                         |
| 18            | Despair                | Overwhelmed by hopelessness; disadvantage on all saving throws and ability checks.                                                                                     |
| 19            | Dissociation           | Loses touch with reality; experiences memory loss or periods of 'blackout' lasting hours.                                                                              |
| 20            | Psychotic Break        | Completely loses grip on reality; becomes incapacitated and requires immediate care or intervention.                                                                   |





- _Mild Anxiety to Despair (1-8 points):_ These effects represent a gradual increase in symptoms as a character becomes more affected by their experiences. Each level adds complexity and challenge to the character’s interactions and decision-making processes.
 - _Severe Effects (9-10 points):_ At these levels, the character’s mental state significantly impairs their ability to function within the game. At 9 points, the character begins to lose touch with who they are and what they are doing, which could lead to missing parts of the adventure or forgetting important information. At 10 points, the character is so deeply affected that they become non-functional, representing a total collapse of their mental faculties.

  _**Recovering Sanity**_ Recovering from the effects of accumulating Sanity points involves a combination of rest, therapeutic activities, magical intervention, and specific in-game events designed to restore a character’s mental equilibrium. (edited)


    
    _**Restorative Rest**_
    
    - _Mechanics:_ A character can recover one Sanity point for every uninterrupted week of rest in a safe, comforting environment, such as a peaceful village, a serene monastery, or their home. This rest includes maintaining a normal routine without exposure to combat, stressful negotiations, or horrific scenes.
    - _Roleplaying Suggestion:_ Players can describe how their characters spend their downtime engaging in hobbies, spending time with loved ones, or simply enjoying quiet solitude to reinforce the roleplaying aspect of recovery.
    
    _**Therapeutic Activities**_ **Types of Therapy:**
    
    - _Counseling:_ Regular sessions with a wise counselor, healer, or priest who can provide guidance and perspective. Effective counseling reduces one Sanity point after three sessions.
    - _Group Support:_ Participating in group therapy with other characters who have faced similar stresses. This can occur in settings like a tavern where adventurers share stories, or a formal support group organized by a temple.
    - _Art Therapy:_ Engaging in artistic expression such as painting, writing, or music. Successfully creating a work of art (determined by an appropriate skill check) can reduce one Sanity point.

    > Mechanics: To implement therapy, a character must spend at least three days engaged in therapeutic activities during a week of downtime. Each successful week of therapy reduces one Sanity point.

 _**Magical Healing**_ **Spells:**

 - _Calm Emotions:_ Can be cast to give temporary relief from the effects of accrued Sanity points, stabilizing a character’s mental state for the duration of the spell.
- _Lesser Restoration:_ Removes temporary effects such as mild anxiety or paranoia but does not reduce Sanity points.
- _Greater Restoration:_ Reduces Sanity points by two when cast, representing significant mental healing.
- _Heal:_ Resets a character’s Sanity points to zero, representing a complete mental recovery. This powerful effect reflects the high level of the spell.

    > Mechanics: Magical interventions can be more immediate but often require resources such as spell slots, components, and access to skilled casters.

_**Inspirational Events**_

- _Mechanics:_ Participating in events that uplift spirits and reaffirm a character’s purpose or faith can also reduce Sanity points. These events might include witnessing a miracle, fulfilling a major life goal, or receiving a blessing from a deity.
- _Effect:_ Depending on the significance of the event, reduce one or more Sanity points. Major events, like fulfilling a character's personal quest or destiny, could reset their Sanity entirely.

Regular Reduction

- _Natural Recovery:_ Characters naturally reduce their Sanity points by one for every month of in-game time that passes without encountering a Sanity-check triggering event, representing the natural resilience and adaptability of the mind.

_**Roleplaying Recovery**_
- Encourage players to deeply engage with their characters' recovery processes, exploring personal growth and change that can emerge from overcoming psychological challenges.
  
### Anxiety Mechanics ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/297337084660940810/1635c2888e06b2ea1be9d2ab0ab9f6fe.webp?size=80)    

**Triggering Anxiety** Anxiety can be triggered by various situations that invoke fear, stress, or tension. These triggers are classified based on their nature and the character’s past experiences:

- **Combat Anxiety:** Triggered during intense battles, especially when the character is injured or when allies are heavily wounded or incapacitated.
- **Social Anxiety:** Triggered during high-stakes social interactions, such as negotiations with powerful NPCs, performances in front of large crowds, or encounters with authoritative figures.
- **Environmental Anxiety:** Triggered by hazardous environments, such as navigating through treacherous terrain, enduring extreme weather, or exploring deeply claustrophobic dungeons.
- **Phobia-Specific Anxiety:** Triggered by encounters with specific phobias a character may have, such as heights, darkness, certain creatures, or magic.
    
**Anxiety Checks** When a trigger occurs, the character must make an Anxiety check to maintain their composure. This check is a Wisdom saving throw, and the DC is determined by the specific circumstances of the trigger:

- **Mild Trigger:** DC 10 (e.g., minor disputes, encountering a disliked but non-threatening creature).
- **Moderate Trigger:** DC 15 (e.g., fighting a formidable enemy, navigating dangerous terrain).
- **Severe Trigger:** DC 20 (e.g., facing a deadly foe known to the character, performing critical tasks under extreme pressure).

Characters with a background or traits that suggest previous exposure or resilience to certain stressors may receive advantage on these checks, whereas those with negative experiences or susceptibilities may have disadvantage.

**Effects of Anxiety** When a character fails an Anxiety check, roll a d6 to determine the specific consequence they face. These effects are designed to integrate seamlessly with D&D mechanics, emphasizing the roleplaying and tactical impacts of anxiety. **Table: Anxiety Effects** | Roll (1d6) | Effect | Mechanical Impact | |------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | 1 | Panic Flight | The character must use their movement to distance themselves from the trigger on their turn, if possible. They have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until they can no longer see the trigger. | | 2 | Paralysis | The character is stunned for 1 round. Afterward, they can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of their turns, with a DC equal to the original Anxiety check DC, to end this effect. | | 3 | Hypervigilance | The character gains advantage on Perception checks but has disadvantage on Concentration checks for spells and other tasks requiring focused attention, lasting for 1d4 hours. | | 4 | Irritability | The character has disadvantage on Charisma-based checks and may inadvertently provoke hostility in social interactions. This effect lasts for 1d4 hours or until the character can calm down during a short rest. | | 5 | Compulsive Behavior | The character feels compelled to engage in repetitive behavior, such as checking equipment or reciting known spells. They must use a bonus action each round on this behavior, lasting for 1d4 hours. | | 6 | Disorientation | The character suffers confusion and has trouble processing their environment. They have disadvantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks for 1d4 hours. |



  **Outcomes of Anxiety Checks** The outcome of an Anxiety check can affect a character’s performance:
 
- **Success:** The character manages to control their anxiety and remains unaffected, maintaining full capability to act.
- **Failure:** The character suffers from anxiety, with effects determined by the severity of the failure:
- **Fail by 1-4:** Temporary effects as outlined in the Anxiety Effects Table.
- **Fail by 5 or more:** More severe or lasting effects, potentially requiring intervention or longer recovery.
 
**Managing Anxiety** Characters can employ strategies to manage their anxiety:

- **Preparation and Planning:** Characters who spend time preparing for specific encounters (studying enemies, rehearsing speeches, acclimating to environments) receive bonuses to their Anxiety checks related to those situations.
- **Coping Mechanisms:** Characters can develop coping mechanisms such as meditation, breathing exercises, or carrying comforting objects. These mechanisms can be used as a bonus action to grant temporary relief (negating anxiety effects for a number of rounds or reducing the DC of future Anxiety checks within the same scenario).

**Recovery and Treatment** Recovery from Anxiety involves both short-term and long-term strategies:

- **Short-term:** Taking a short rest in a safe environment allows a character to reroll a failed Anxiety check with advantage, potentially reducing the impact of any ongoing effects.
- **Long-term:** Engaging in regular therapy sessions, seeking spiritual guidance, or undergoing specific training programs during downtime can gradually decrease the susceptibility to anxiety or even remove certain triggers.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- _**Bloodlust Mechanic**_ Whenever a Bloodlust trigger occurs, the character must make a Charisma saving throw to resist the urge to succumb to their primal instincts. The base mechanics of these checks are as follows:
    
    - **Base DC:** Determined by the trigger type, ranging from DC 10 for a critical hit to DC 15 for witnessing extreme violence or severe personal injury.
    - **Check Timing:** The check is made immediately after the triggering event.
    
    **Factors Influencing Bloodlust Checks** Several factors can modify the DC or the character's ability to succeed on a Bloodlust check:
    
    - **Emotional State:** If the character is already agitated, frightened, or enraged, they may have disadvantage on Bloodlust checks. Conversely, if they are calm or under the influence of spells like _calm emotions_, they may have advantage.
    - **Fatigue:** Exhaustion levels can affect Bloodlust checks. Characters with one or more levels of exhaustion may have disadvantage on these checks due to diminished self-control.
    - **Personal History:** Characters with a background of violence or trauma may have a lower threshold for Bloodlust, reducing the DC by up to 2. Characters who are trained soldiers or have disciplined martial training might receive a bonus (+2) to their Bloodlust checks.
    - **Magical Influences:** Certain spells or magical effects that manipulate emotions or mental state can alter Bloodlust checks. For instance, enchantment spells that boost aggression could lower the DC, while protective wards against fear or charm could provide a bonus.
    
    _**Triggering Bloodlust:**_**
    
    1. Personal Kill
    
    **
    
    - **Description:** When a character personally delivers the final blow to an enemy, the visceral reality of combat can invoke a primal response.
    - **Trigger Condition:** The character kills an enemy.
    - **Check Requirement:** No immediate check required, but subsequent kills within the same battle increase the difficulty of resisting Bloodlust.
    
    **
    
    2. Critical Damage
    
    **
    
    - **Description:** Landing a particularly brutal or effective attack can exhilarate and excite a character, pushing them closer to a state of frenzy.
    - **Trigger Condition:** The character scores a critical hit that deals significant damage (top 25% of possible damage range for the weapon or spell used).
    - **Check Requirement:** Charisma saving throw, DC 10, increases by 2 for each additional critical hit in the same encounter.
    
    **
    
    3. Witnessing Extreme Violence
    
    **
    
    - **Description:** Seeing an ally or enemy engage in particularly brutal acts, such as executing prisoners or defeating a foe in a gruesome manner, can trigger a psychological response ranging from fear to exhilaration.
    - **Trigger Condition:** Witnessing a brutal act by either ally or enemy, including but not limited to executions, torturous acts, or overwhelming destructive spells that cause massive carnage.
    - **Check Requirement:** Charisma saving throw, DC 12, modified by the character’s alignment and past experiences (e.g., a lawful good character might have a higher DC due to the conflict with their moral code).
    
    **
    
    4. Survival Instinct
    
    **
    
    - **Description:** When severely wounded, the instinct to survive can morph into a ferocious will to fight, igniting a frenetic and reckless combat style.
    - **Trigger Condition:** The character’s hit points drop below 25% of their maximum due to enemy actions.
    - **Check Requirement:** Charisma saving throw, DC 15, reflecting the intense pressure and pain driving the character towards irrational aggression.
    
    (edited)
    
6. _[_6:48 PM_]_
    
    **
    
    5. Threat to Comrades
    
    **
    
    - **Description:** The potential loss or severe injury of a close ally can trigger a protective and violent response, often disregarding personal safety in the process.
    - **Trigger Condition:** A close ally within visual range drops to 0 hit points or is captured by the enemy.
    - **Check Requirement:** Charisma saving throw, DC 15, can be influenced by the character’s relationship with the ally (stronger bonds might increase the DC).
    
    _**Cumulative Effects**_
    
    - **Stacking Triggers:** Each trigger during a single encounter makes resisting subsequent triggers more difficult. For example, if a character has already entered Bloodlust due to a personal kill, seeing an ally fall might only require a failed check at a higher DC to deepen the frenzy.
    - **Role of Emotions:** Characters with certain personality traits (like a history of violence or trauma) or under the influence of magic that affects emotions might have altered thresholds or additional modifiers for these checks.
    
    _**Consequences of Failing a Bloodlust Check**_ Failing a Bloodlust check leads to the character entering a state of frenzy, with specific consequences:
    
    - **Duration:** The frenzy typically lasts for the duration of the combat or until no visible threats remain. The DM may allow an additional Charisma saving throw at the end of each of the character’s turns to recover from Bloodlust.
    - **Behavioral Effects:** While frenzied, the character focuses solely on attacking the nearest enemy, using the most effective and aggressive means available. They may ignore tactical retreats, defensive maneuvers, or non-combatant safety.
    - **Post-Combat Effects:** After exiting Bloodlust, a character might suffer temporary penalties due to fatigue, such as disadvantage on all ability checks and movement speed reduction by 10 feet for 1 hour. They may also need to contend with the psychological aftermath of their actions, potentially requiring a Sanity check if their actions were particularly brutal or out of character.
    
    **Mitigating Bloodlust** Characters can take preventive measures to mitigate the effects of Bloodlust:
    
    - **Pre-Combat Preparation:** Engaging in mental preparation or meditative practices before anticipated combat can grant a temporary bonus (+2) to the next Bloodlust check.
    - **Comrades' Intervention:** Allies can attempt to calm a frenzied character by using their action to talk down, physically restrain, or otherwise aid the character, granting advantage on the next Bloodlust check.
    
### Hearty Breakfast Mechanic  ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/297337084660940810/1635c2888e06b2ea1be9d2ab0ab9f6fe.webp?size=80)    
Eating a nutritious breakfast provides characters with a temporary boost to their abilities due to increased energy and concentration. This benefit can affect various rolls throughout the day.

###### Benefits of a Hearty Breakfast:
- **Morning Vigor:** After consuming a hearty breakfast, a player can roll an additional 1d4 and add the result to all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. This bonus lasts until their next long rest.
- **Duration:** The boost from a hearty breakfast lasts for the duration of the day or until the character completes a long rest.

###### **Mechanics of Eating Breakfast**
- **Preparation Time:** Preparing and eating a hearty breakfast requires at least 30 minutes in the morning.
- **Ingredients Required:** A hearty breakfast must include a variety of foods such as meats, eggs, bread, and fruits or vegetables to be considered sufficient to grant the bonus.

###### **Adaptation Over Time** 
*Over time, a character's body may become accustomed to receiving this nutritional boost, reducing its effectiveness.*

- **First 7 Days:** For the first week of consistently eating a hearty breakfast, the bonus remains at 1d4.
- **After 7 Days:** After seven consecutive days of eating a hearty breakfast, the body starts to adapt, and the bonus decreases to 1d3.
- **After 14 Days:** After fourteen consecutive days, the bonus decreases further to 1d2, reflecting the body’s full adaptation to the increased nutrition.
- **Reset Mechanism:** If a character misses a hearty breakfast for one or more days, the effect resets, and they can again receive the full 1d4 bonus when they resume eating breakfast regularly.
    
    **Variability in Diet**
    
    - **Diet Variation:** To counteract the adaptation effect, characters can vary their breakfast diet significantly every few days to include different types of foods, spices, or magical ingredients which can reset or delay the adaptation phase.
    - **Special Ingredients:** Occasionally including rare or magical ingredients in the breakfast (such as spices from exotic locations or enchanted honey) can maintain the 1d4 bonus for longer periods or enhance other abilities temporarily.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Sprains and Breaks Mechanics**
    
    - **Combat:** Occur from critical hits, falls, or when a character is hit by a large or particularly strong creature.
    - **Non-combat:** Can happen during strenuous activities like climbing, jumping, or when failing a physical check by 5 or more under hazardous conditions.
    
    **Identification and Immediate Action**
    
    - **Detection:** A character or an ally must make a DC 15 Medicine check to assess the injury.
    - **Immediate Treatment:** If the Medicine check is successful, they can properly immobilize the injured area using splints or bandages from a healer’s kit. Failure increases the recovery time by 50%.
    
    **Effects of Sprains**
    
    - **Mobility:** Movement speed is reduced by half.
    - **Ability Impacts:** Disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws that involve movement or balance.
    - **Duration of Recovery:** 1d4+1 days of rest or reduced activity. Magical healing or treatment by a character proficient in Medicine can reduce this time.
    
    **Effects of Breaks**
    
    - **Severity:** Classified into minor breaks (fingers, toes) and major breaks (arms, legs, ribs).
        
        - **Minor Breaks:** Impose disadvantage on checks involving the injured part (e.g., holding a shield, manipulating objects).
        - **Major Breaks:** Render the limb largely unusable, impose disadvantage on any action that would stress the limb, and reduce movement speed to a quarter if a leg is broken.
        
    - **Duration of Recovery:**
        
        - **Minor Breaks:** 1d6+1 weeks with rest.
        - **Major Breaks:** 2d4+2 weeks. Use of a bone-setting procedure (DC 18 Medicine check) can reduce this by one week. Failure increases recovery time.
        
    
    **Long-Term Consequences**
    
    - **Improper Healing:** Without proper care or if initial treatment fails, the injury might heal improperly. This could lead to chronic pain (inflicting periodic disadvantage on related checks) or reduced functionality (permanent -5 feet movement if a leg is involved, or -2 penalty to related skill checks if an arm is involved).
    - **Re-injury Risk:** For 1d6 months after recovery, stressful activity may risk re-injury, triggering a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to avoid aggravating the condition.
    
    **Magical Healing**
    
    - **Lesser Restoration:** Can immediately resolve a sprain and reduce the recovery time for breaks by half.
    - **Regenerate or Greater Restoration:** Required for immediately healing major breaks or correcting improperly healed injuries.
    
### Bleeding Mechanics ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/297337084660940810/1635c2888e06b2ea1be9d2ab0ab9f6fe.webp?size=80)    

- **Combat:** Bleeding is typically triggered by slashing or piercing weapons that deal significant damage.
          
    - **Trigger Condition:** When a character takes damage from a slashing or piercing attack that exceeds 10% of their maximum hit points in one strike, or from a critical hit.
        
    - **Environmental and Trap Injuries:** Sharp objects, spikes, or falling onto jagged surfaces can also cause bleeding.
        
        - **Trigger Condition:** Whenever damage from such sources meets or exceeds the 10% threshold.
        
    
    **Understanding the 10% Threshold for Bleeding** The 10% threshold is calculated based on a character's maximum hit points, which represent the total amount of damage a character can take before becoming incapacitated. By using 10% of maximum hit points as a criterion, the rule ensures that bleeding is triggered only by relatively significant wounds, reflecting the idea that minor scratches or small cuts aren't typically severe enough to cause concerning blood loss.
    
    > **Calculation Example:**
    > 
    > - **Character's Maximum Hit Points:** 50
    > - **10% of Maximum Hit Points:** 5 hit points
    
    **Bleeding Effects**
    
    - **Immediate Loss:** Upon triggering a bleed, a character immediately loses additional hit points.
        
        - **Minor Wound:** Bleeding causes the loss of 1d4 hit points at the start of each turn.
        - **Major Wound:** Bleeding causes the loss of 1d6 hit points at the start of each turn.
        
    - **Ongoing Impact:** Bleeding continues until treated effectively or until the character falls unconscious or stabilizes.
    
    **Bleeding Checks and Treatment**
    
    - **First Aid (Medicine Check):**
        
        - A DC 12 Medicine check using a healer’s kit can temporarily stop minor bleeding, or DC 15 for major bleeding.
        - Success means the bleeding is stopped. Failure by 5 or more can worsen the bleeding by one degree (e.g., from 1d4 to 1d6).
        
    - **Magical Healing:** Any spell or ability that restores hit points also stops the bleeding.
    
    **Long-Term Effects and Complications**
    
    - **Infection Risk:** If bleeding is not properly treated and cleaned, there is a risk of infection.
        
        - An untreated wound has a 10% chance per day of becoming infected, leading to further complications.
        
    - **Weakened State:** Prolonged bleeding without adequate rest or treatment can lead to weakness.
        
        - **Exhaustion:** Each hour of continuous bleeding increases the risk of gaining a level of exhaustion.
        
    
    **Special Conditions**
    
    - **Critical Bleeding:** If a character suffers from multiple bleeding wounds simultaneously, or a major artery is presumed hit, the bleeding worsens significantly.
        
        - **Critical Bleeding Condition:** Bleeding increases to 1d8 hit points lost per turn, and the DC to stop the bleeding increases by 5.
        
    
    **Recovery from Bleeding**
    
    - **Aftercare:** Once bleeding is stopped, proper wound care is required to prevent reopening or infection.
        
        - A daily DC 10 Medicine check is needed for 1d4 days to ensure proper healing.
        
    - **Rest:** Characters recovering from significant blood loss might need additional rest.
        
        - **Recommended Downtime:** One day of rest for each instance of major bleeding experienced, to restore full strength and vitality.
        

 
### Combo Moves and Team Attacks ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/297337084660940810/1635c2888e06b2ea1be9d2ab0ab9f6fe.webp?size=80)    

##### Requirements and Setup:**_**
1. Proximity and Positioning
- **Proximity Requirement:** Participants must be within 5 feet for melee cooperation or up to 30 feet for ranged or magical coordination.
- **Strategic Positioning:** For flanking maneuvers, characters need to be on opposite sides of the target.

2. Initiative Synchronization
- **Coordinated Initiative:** Participants synchronize their initiatives by holding actions or having the same initiative until the last participant's turn.
- **Turn Order Management:** Participants may adjust their actions in the initiative sequence to match the slowest member for that round.
   
3. Action and Resource Allocation
- **Action Cost:** Each participant commits their action for the round to the combo move, using standard actions, bonus actions, or reactions.
- **Resource Consumption:** Some combos require the expenditure of spell slots, special ability charges, or items.

4. Planning and Communication
- **Pre-Combat Planning:** Characters can plan combo moves during downtime or strategy sessions.
- **In-Combat Communication:** Participants must effectively communicate, possibly requiring verbal cues, hand signals, or other methods.

5. Skill and Proficiency Requirements
- **Skill Checks:** Some combos may require specific skill checks, like an Acrobatics or Athletics check, to initiate.
- **Proficiency Bonuses:** Characters proficient in relevant skills or with specific weapons can contribute these bonuses to the combo’s effectiveness.

##### **Examples for Combo Moves**
    
1. **Flanking Strike**
- **Setup:** Two melee combatants must be on opposite sides of an enemy.
- **Execution:** Both characters attempt stealth or deception checks (DC based on enemy's perception) to position without detection.
 - **Example:** A rogue and a fighter target an orc. If both successfully position themselves and attack, the orc's attention is divided.
- **Benefit:** Adds +2 to each character's damage rolls, and the orc receives a -2 penalty to its AC until the start of the next round.
            
        
    
    **
    
    2. Arcane Synergy
    
    **
    
    - **Setup:** Spellcasters choose complementary spells.
        
        - **Execution:** Both must succeed on a combined Arcana check (DC 15 + level of the highest spell).
            
            - **Example:** A wizard casts _Grease_, followed by a sorcerer's _Fire Bolt_. Successful synergy ignites the grease.
            - **Benefit:** The ignited _Grease_ burns for 1d4 rounds, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature within the area.
            
        
    
    **
    
    3. Guard and Strike
    
    **
    
    - **Setup:** Combines a tank's defensive capabilities with another character's offensive attacks.
        
        - **Execution:** The defender uses an Intimidation check or physical engagement to draw the enemy's focus.
            
            - **Example:** A paladin uses Protection to cover a cleric casting _Guiding Bolt_, which is then cast with advantage.
            - **Benefit:** The cleric gains advantage on the attack, increasing hit probability and enhancing the subsequent effect of _Guiding Bolt_.

    4. Healer's Cover
    
    **
    
    - **Setup:** A healer and a protector coordinate, with the protector providing physical cover.
        
        - **Execution:** The protector must pass an Athletics or Acrobatics check to shield the healer effectively.
            
            - **Example:** A bard prepares to heal a ranger while a barbarian shields the bard, protecting against enemy attacks.
            - **Benefit:** The healing spell's effectiveness increases by 50%, and the bard receives +2 AC from the barbarian's cover, reducing interruption risk.
            
        
    
    **Dice Rolls for Combo Moves**
    
    - **Coordination Check:** Before executing a combo move, the participants must succeed on a Coordination Check. This is a group check where each participant rolls a d20 and adds their proficiency bonus if applicable. The DC is determined by the complexity of the move:
        
        - **Simple (Flanking Strike):** DC 10
        - **Moderate (Guard and Strike, Healer's Cover):** DC 15
        - **Complex (Arcane Synergy):** DC 20
        
    
    **
    
    1. Execution Checks
    
    **
    
    - **Individual Role Contribution:** Each participant must make specific checks depending on their role in the combo:
        
        - **Attackers (Flanking Strike, Guard and Strike):** Make attack rolls as normal, but with the potential benefits from successful coordination (e.g., advantage on attack rolls).
        - **Spellcasters (Arcane Synergy):** Cast their spells requiring a successful spell attack roll or the target failing a saving throw. The effectiveness or alteration of the spell effects hinges on the initial Coordination Check.
        - **Defenders/Protectors (Healer’s Cover):** Make an Athletics or Acrobatics check to effectively shield the healer. The DC should reflect the enemy's attack capabilities, typically around 15.
        
    
    **
    
    2. Combo Execution Success
    
    **
    
    - **Group Success:** If the majority of the participants succeed in their execution checks, the combo move is considered successful, and all intended effects apply.
    - **Partial Success:** If only some participants succeed, the combo move's effects might be diminished or altered, at the DM’s discretion.
    - **Failure:** If the majority fail their checks, the combo move fails, which might expose the group to counterattacks or other penalties.
    
    **
    
    3. Additional Dice Rolls and Modifiers
    
    **
    
    - **Critical Success and Failure:** If any participant rolls a natural 20 during their execution check, the combo move might have an enhanced effect. Conversely, a natural 1 by any participant could lead to a complication or failure.
    - **Synergy Bonus:** If the Coordination Check exceeds the DC by 5 or more, add a synergy bonus to the outcome. For example, increase damage output, extend the effect duration, or improve defensive bonuses.
    
    **
    
    4. Learning and Improving Combo Moves
    
    **
    
    - **Training Sessions:** Characters can spend downtime improving their coordination for specific combo moves, reducing the DC of future Coordination Checks or increasing the synergy bonus.
    - **Experience:** As characters gain levels or spend more time together, they might unlock new combo moves or enhance existing ones, reflecting their growing teamwork and combat prowess.
    
    **Mechanics and Rules for Custom Combo Moves****
    
    1. Proposal and Conceptualization
    
    **
    
    - **Player Collaboration:** Players must collaborate to design a combo move, outlining the strategic goals and expected outcomes. They should specify which abilities, spells, or skills are combined.
    - **Concept Submission:** Players submit their combo move concept to the DM, detailing the involved actions, expected effects, and any creative elements or story integration.
    
    **
    
    2. Resource and Action Requirements
    
    **
    
    - **Action Economy:** Define the action types required (standard, bonus, reaction) for each participant. Specify if the move uses up all participants' actions for the round.
    - **Resource Consumption:** Outline any resource costs such as spell slots, charges from magic items, or limited-use class features. Specify any additional material components or special equipment needed.
    
12. _[_7:52 PM_]_
    
    **
    
    3. Execution Mechanics
    
    **
    
    - **Coordination Roll:** Introduce a coordination roll to initiate the combo. Participants make a group skill check (e.g., Athletics, Acrobatics, Arcana) based on the nature of the combo. The DC is determined by the combo's complexity.
    - **Effectiveness Check:** Following successful coordination, effectiveness is determined by individual rolls related to the combo's nature—attack rolls for combat moves, spell attack rolls for magical combos, or additional skill checks for strategic maneuvers.
    - **Critical Success/Failure:** Define outcomes for critical success (natural 20) and critical failures (natural 1), such as enhanced effects or unintended consequences.
    
    **
    
    4. Balancing and Limitations
    
    **
    
    - **Cooldown Period:** After execution, the combo move enters a cooldown period. Simple combos have a shorter cooldown (e.g., 1-2 rounds), while more complex ones might require a longer cooldown (e.g., entire encounter or until a short rest).
    - **Frequency of Use:** Limit the frequency of use to prevent over-reliance on powerful combos. Suggest once per encounter for simple combos and once per session or day for complex ones.
    - **Balance Adjustments:** The DM should monitor the impact of the combo move and suggest balance adjustments as necessary, considering the overall campaign dynamics and other players’ engagement.
    
    **
    
    5. Practice and Proficiency
    
    **
    
    - **Training Requirement:** Characters must spend downtime training to gain proficiency with the new combo move. This could involve a number of days equal to the combo's complexity level (e.g., 3 days for a moderately complex combo).
    - **Skill Proficiency Benefits:** Characters proficient in relevant skills or with certain abilities may reduce training time or improve the effectiveness of the combo move.
    
    **
    
    6. Documentation and Official Inclusion
    
    **
    
    - **Written Record:** Maintain a written record of all approved combo moves, including detailed descriptions, mechanics, and any historical uses in the campaign.
    - **Approval Process:** The DM reviews and officially approves the combo move for use in the game, ensuring it fits within the campaign’s narrative and mechanical balance.
