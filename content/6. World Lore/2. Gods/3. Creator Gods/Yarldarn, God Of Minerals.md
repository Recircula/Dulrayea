> [!example|overview bg-c-purple]- Overview 
>  neutral deity, is the gnome god of stone, the deep underground, and mining. His titles include the Deep Brother and the Master of Stone. He and his followers derive joy from the discovery and mining of rubies and other types of gems. He is the patron of deep gnomes and is consequently worshiped by most members of that race. He and his followers actively oppose those who would destroy the deep gnomes: the evil Underdark races such as the drow, kuo-toas, and illithids. The domains associated with him are Earth and Protection, and his favored weapon is the battleaxe.
