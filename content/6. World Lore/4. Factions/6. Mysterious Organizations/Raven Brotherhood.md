>>The Raven Brotherhood, a clandestine order shrouded in mystery and fear, operates from the darkest corners of Dulrayea. Its elite, the [[Nightshades]], are forged through a harrowing process that begins with the kidnapping of children at the tender age of two. Unbeknownst to the world, these children are destined for a life far removed from normalcy, a life in the shadows.
>>
>>At the age of five, these children undergo their first trial by fire. The "[[Mysticus Mordax]]," a dreaded arcane dampener, is injected directly into their lumbar, cervical, and cerebellum. This procedure is not only physically excruciating but also spiritually debilitating. The serum is designed to sever their connection to the arcane, a cruel method of ensuring that these young souls do not grow reliant on magical abilities. However, the serum's effects are far more sinister. The children are subjected to a terrifying array of side effects: a complete loss of arcane sense, irreversible madness, Voidburn, pale and lifeless skin, a state of being Void-woken, arcane burns, arcane harvesting, and in most cases, death. Out of the innumerable side effects cataloged, and 35 stand out for their particular cruelty and frequency.
>>
>>Survival through this initial phase is rare, with only 6% to 15% of the children making it through. The survivors, known collectively as "[[the flock]]," consist of 12 children per group. They are then subjected to a rigorous and relentless training regime. This regime is not mere education; it is an ordeal designed to break and remold them. It encompasses extensive defensive and offensive combat training, pushing their bodies and minds to the brink. The training also includes tests of endurance, such as grueling mountain climbs and forced starvation, as well as learning to cope with various types of wounds and encounters with voidal creatures. The mortality rate during this phase is astronomical, with most children perishing by the ages of 6 or 7.
>>
>>The few who endure this brutal upbringing and reach the age of 12 are then integrated into the next phase of their training, as part of the "[[Harbingers]]." Each Harbinger group is led by a Talon, a veteran member of the Raven Brotherhood, who imparts knowledge in the darker arts of warfare and subterfuge. This includes intelligence gathering, kidnapping, extortion, hostage rescue, assassinations, and the protection of individuals deemed worthy by the Oracles. The Oracles, a mysterious group within the Brotherhood, are said to possess the ability to foresee significant events and individuals who will play pivotal roles in the future of Dulrayea. After nine additional years of this grueling training, the survivors ascend to the rank of Nightshade. 
>>
>>The Nightshades, molded into existence by the Raven Brotherhood, stand as the ultimate weapon in the arsenal of the shadowy organization. They are more than just soldiers or spies; they are the embodiment of a dark philosophy, a creed written in blood and secrecy. Their journey from the tormented children of the flock to the enigmatic protectors of Dulrayea is a saga of pain, resilience, and unwavering loyalty to the Brotherhood's cause. The Harbinger phase of their training is where these children, barely clinging to their humanity, are forged into instruments of power and control. Under the guidance of the Talons, they delve into the underworld of espionage, learning the arts of subterfuge and manipulation. These young apprentices are taught to gather intelligence not just through surveillance, but through coercion, blackmail, and the exploitation of human weaknesses. Kidnapping and extortion become tools in their hands, wielded with a cold, dispassionate efficiency. They are also trained in the delicate art of hostage rescue and assassination, skills that require a blend of precision, ruthlessness, and a disconnection from the normal moral constraints.
>>
>>[[The Oracles]], these seers of the Brotherhood, play a crucial role in guiding the Harbingers. They are not just predictors of the future; they are strategists who see the web of causality and influence. Their decrees are not questioned, for they are believed to possess an understanding of the cosmic tapestry that is beyond the grasp of ordinary minds. The individuals they deem worthy of protection are often pivotal figures in the grand scheme of the Brotherhood, their safety integral to the realization of long-term goals. Upon reaching the rank of [[Nightshade]], these warriors shed their last vestiges of childhood. The removal of the "Mysticus Mordax" is a rite of passage, a symbolic and physical liberation from the chains of their tortured past. Yet, it also serves as a reminder of the irrevocable transformation they have undergone. No longer mere pawns or victims, they emerge as masterminds and executors of the Brotherhood's will.
>>
>>Their choices post-ascension are a reflection of their individual natures. Some choose to remain with their Harbinger units, finding a semblance of kinship and belonging in these groups. Others, hardened and solitary, opt for the path of lone operatives, undertaking missions that require a level of discretion and skill only a Nightshade can offer. Regardless of their path, their mission remains unaltered â€“ the protection and control of the center capitals. [[Crimson Palisades]], a fortress enshrouded in mystery, stands as a symbol of the Brotherhood's might. [[Sebeth, The City Of Twilight]], represents the duality of their existence, forever balancing between light and darkness. [[Cerulset]] is a nexus of arcane knowledge, a trove of secrets guarded zealously by the Nightshades. [[Kleisthold]], with its military significance, is a testament to their strategic prowess. Each location, chosen by the Oracles, forms a vital part of the Brotherhood's overarching plan.
>>
>>In contrast to the ethereal presence of the Nightshades, the Brotherhood's lesser members, known as [[Dusk Sentinels]] often young adults between 16 and 20, serve a more visible and conventional role. They are the face the Brotherhood shows to the world, a necessary distraction from the true machinations happening in the shadows. These members are trained rigorously but not with the same brutal intensity as the Nightshades. They engage in intelligence gathering, frontline combat, and public relations, serving as the Brotherhood's connection to the ordinary world. The relationship between the Nightshades and these lesser members is complex and layered with a mixture of disdain and reliance. The Nightshades view them as necessary but inferior, a buffer that allows them to operate unseen. Yet, they acknowledge the importance of these members in maintaining the balance, serving as the eyes and ears in places where the Nightshades cannot tread openly.
>>
>>The Nightshades are the silent sentinels of Dulrayea, their existence a blend of myth and reality. They are the unseen hand that steers the course of nations, the whisper in the ear of kings and queens, the shadow that passes unseen even in the light of day. Their actions are unrecorded, their sacrifices unseen, and their loyalty to the Brotherhood unwavering. They are the embodiment of the Raven Brotherhood's power, shaping the destiny of Dulrayea from the depths of the shadows, forever hidden, forever vigilant.
