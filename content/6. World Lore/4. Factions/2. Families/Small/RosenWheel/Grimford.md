>>   A smaller Family in Rosen Wheel know as Grimford, helps with the [[Dulrayea!/Z_Pictures/2. Group Npcs art/2. Families/Buckstones/Buckstones]] movement of small cargo, shipments, exotics meats, and animals. The Buckstones in the pass never requested the aid of other families. But, in the last 90 years the Buckstones have been using other smaller families to aid them with finishing other contracts. The Grimfords have aided in such contracts for awhile now. They where the first to be hired into the Buckstones and are the most loyal to them.

>>   The Grimfords mostly being Dwarves help move cargo through discreet areas. They also are known for being highly protective towards the cargo that they are given to them. It is widely known that if you see the house symbol of  Grimford while trying to steal or break into the creates of the Buckstones that you will be dealing with a man or woman who will die protecting that item. The Father known as [[Daloden Grimford]] and his son [[Hugar Grimford]] are the two leaders of the family.
