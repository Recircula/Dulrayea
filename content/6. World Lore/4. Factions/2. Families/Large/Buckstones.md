>   **"In the shadowed heart of [[Rosen Wheel]], we, the Buckstones, reign supreme. Our legacy is written in blood and whispered in fear. From the savage howls of Fangor's lycanthropic fury, to the silent terror of Ravenna's nocturnal beasts; from Grimclaw's poisonous wrath, to Ironmaw's iron-fisted rule, and Shadowfang's harrowing darkness, we embody the relentless power of nightmares. Our symbols - the wolf's howl, the raven's feather, the blood-red spice, the clenched fist, and the mirror that reflects no light - are the heralds of our dominion. We are the unchallenged, the merciless, the eternal shadow that consumes the light. Fear our names, for in defiance, there is only ruin."**

>> 1. **Savage Fangor Buckstones - The Slave Master**: Savage Fangor Buckstones, a beast in the guise of a man, is the epitome of ruthless savagery in [[Rosen Wheel]]. His bloodlust knows no bounds. He doesn't just rule the slave trade; he revels in the terror and despair he inflicts. His hunts are nightmarish excursions into the city, where he captures not just bodies but crushes spirits, taking perverse pleasure in the destruction he leaves in his wake. Fangor's arenas are hells on earth, where he orchestrates diabolical tortures, dismembering his victims while they're still alive, their agonized screams music to his ears. His hatred for Night Howler Ravenna Buckstones is a fiery inferno, driving him to even greater depths of brutality.
>>    - **Display Of Victims** - Savage Fangor Buckstones, the lycanthropic terror of [[Rosen Wheel]], displays his victims as a gruesome warning. In the heart of his stronghold, a grotesque gallery exists where he showcases his defeated enemies. The bodies are often still partially alive, contorted in eternal agony, their limbs twisted in unnatural positions. Fangor takes a macabre pride in this display, often adorning the walls with the severed heads of those who dared defy him, their eyes gouged out, mouths frozen in a silent scream. This horrifying spectacle serves as a stark reminder of his merciless rule.
>>    - **Calling Card** - Savage Fangor Buckstones leaves behind a chilling calling card with each of his gruesome displays – a silver pendant shaped like a howling wolf, dripping with the blood of his victims. This pendant, known throughout [[Rosen Wheel]], symbolizes his lycanthropic nature and his unbridled savagery. It's often found clutched in the hands of his mutilated victims or hanging around their necks, a grim token of his dominance and a reminder of the fate that awaits those who oppose him.
>>    
>> 2. **Night Howler Ravenna Buckstones - The Rare Beast Trader**: Cold and calculating, Ravenna Buckstones, the Night Howler of [[Rosen Wheel]], commands her beasts to carry out her darkest whims. She is not just a trader but a predator, stalking her victims with a chilling precision. Her creatures are extensions of her will, trained to hunt, maim, and terrorize. She steals not just possessions but the very essence of life, leaving behind a trail of mangled bodies. Her ruthless nature is particularly evident in her dealings with Blood Eye Grimclaw Buckstones, where she employs her beasts to dismantle his operations, piece by bloody piece.
>>    - **Display Of Victims** - Ravenna Buckstones exhibits her victims in a manner that chills the soul. In the dark corners of Rosenwheel, she creates public displays of her defeated enemies, using her rare beasts to maim them in specific, ritualistic ways. The bodies are often found posed in the center of the city squares, torn apart with surgical precision, their entrails artistically draped over the remnants of their bodies. These macabre scenes serve as a testament to her power and a warning to those who might cross her path.
>>    - **Calling Card** - Night Howler Ravenna Buckstones marks her territory with a distinct symbol - a black feather, plucked from the rarest of her dark creatures. This feather is left at the scenes of her macabre displays, often pinned to the victims or left in their open mouths. It's a symbol that speaks of her control over beasts both rare and fearsome, and it serves as a warning sign of her reach and influence within the dark corners of Rosenwheel.
>>  
>> 3. **Blood Eye Grimclaw Buckstones - The Spice Kingpin**: Blood Eye Grimclaw Buckstones, a corrupted elf, has turned Rosenwheel into a playground of pain and suffering. His spice trade is a front for his true passion – inflicting pain. He doesn't just trade in rare spices; he trades in agony, using his knowledge of potions to concoct new ways to torture his victims. His methods are not just violent; they are an art form of suffering. Buildings that stand against him are razed to the ground, their inhabitants left to rue the day they crossed him. His feud with Unyielding Ironmaw Buckstones is a war not just for territory but for the title of the most feared in all of Rosenwheel.
>>    - **Display Of Victims** - Blood Eye Grimclaw Buckstones has a particularly sinister method of displaying his victims. In the shadows of Rosenwheel, he hangs his enemies, drenched in the rare and exotic spices he trades, from the city's gates. Their bodies are often mutilated, with Grimclaw's signature cuts that cause the most pain without immediate death. The victims are left to suffer for days, their cries a haunting melody that echoes through the streets, a grim reminder of his unyielding dominance.
>>    - **Calling Card** - Blood Eye Grimclaw Buckstones' calling card is a small, intricately carved vial, filled with a rare, blood-red spice. This vial is left beside each of his tortured victims, its contents spilled out in a symbolic gesture. The sight of this vial instills fear in the hearts of Rosenwheel's citizens, as it is synonymous with Grimclaw's mastery over pain and his extensive knowledge of exotic, agonizing poisons.
>>    
>> 4. **Unyielding Ironmaw Buckstones - The Trafficker of Forbidden Goods**: Ironmaw is a tyrant whose mere presence instills fear in the heart of Rosenwheel. He is a force of nature, unstoppable and unyielding. His trade in forbidden goods is a mere front for his true passion – domination. He takes what he wants, when he wants, consequences be damned. His enforcers are not just soldiers; they are agents of chaos, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. The conflict with Silent Stalker Shadowfang Buckstones is not just a feud; it's a cataclysmic clash that tears apart the very fabric of society. 
>>    - **Display Of Victims** - Ironmaw's displays of his victims are a study in terror. In the labyrinthine passages of Rosenwheel, he impales the bodies of his enemies on spikes along the main thoroughfares. These impaled figures are often arranged in a macabre procession, their faces contorted in expressions of terror and pain. The streets near his fortress are lined with these gruesome totems, serving as a ghastly deterrent to anyone who dares oppose him.
>>    - **Calling Card** - Unyielding Ironmaw Buckstones leaves a unique symbol - a small iron coin, stamped with the image of a clenched fist. This coin is often found in the mouths or hands of his impaled victims. It serves as a stark reminder of his unyielding grip on power and the unbreakable hold he has over the forbidden markets of Rosenwheel. The sight of this coin sends a clear message: resistance against Ironmaw is futile.
>>    
>> 5. **Silent Stalker Shadowfang Buckstones - The Harvester of Sorrow**: In the shadowy alleys of Rosenwheel, Silent Stalker Shadowfang Buckstones is a name synonymous with death and despair. He is not just a trader of misery; he is its architect. His tactics are cruel and unusual, involving elaborate schemes to capture, torture, and utterly break his victims. The streets are his hunting grounds, where he preys on the weak and the strong alike, sowing seeds of terror with each step he takes. His ongoing battle with the Galeheart members is a spectacle of gore and destruction, leaving nothing but death and devastation in its path.
>>    - **Display Of Victims** - Silent Stalker Shadowfang Buckstones displays his victims in a manner that strikes fear into the hearts of Rosenwheel's inhabitants. He leaves the mutilated bodies of his enemies in highly visible public places, often staged in dramatic, terrifying scenes. A signature of his is to remove the eyes of his victims, leaving them blind and helpless in their final moments. These bodies are frequently found at dawn, in places like town squares or hanging from city walls, their faces twisted in a final expression of horror, serving as a morbid warning of his lethal capabilities.
>>    - **Calling Card** - Silent Stalker Shadowfang Buckstones leaves a haunting calling card with his victims - a small, black mirror with no reflection. This mirror, often found near the bodies, symbolizes the blindness and despair he inflicts upon his enemies. It's a reminder of the inescapable darkness that he brings, a darkness where one's reflection, one's identity, is lost forever. The discovery of this mirror at a crime scene sends shivers down the spines of those in Rosenwheel, for it is the mark of a predator who revels in the psychological torment of his prey.
