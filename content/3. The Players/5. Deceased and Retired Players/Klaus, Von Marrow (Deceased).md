## Backstory:
>My name is Klaus von Marrow. I'm a 42-year-old human. I was born of lower nobility in a small village named Delton. My father and head of the house, [[Otto Von Marrow]], was a very diligent man. He was rarely around during my upbringing. If he wasn't going to feasts, he was going on business trips. My father, as distant as he was, made up for it when he could by visiting me once a month to go stag hunting. He taught me everything from hunting to stewardship. I idolized that man. My mother, [[Beretta Von Marrow]] always loved me despite being a rowdy child. She always cleaned up my mess after causing havoc at the tavern or harassing the local livestock. Our wealth was built upon our rich coal mines and tobacco farms. We hired the local townsfolk to do the menial labor for decent pay. 
>
> While I was 16, my parents were trying to contact the nearby Elvish settlement of [[Aulra]] to establish trade routes. Roughly a week later after their departure, I received the most grim news. My parents were found dead in their carriage, covered in a blanket of arrows. I've always associated my parents' death with those damn filthy elves.  When I was given the news of the death of my parents I was overflowed with emotions of rage and sadness. After my coronation, I gave a speech to the villagers in the town square showing them my parent’s carriage riddled with elvish arrows. I decreed that every elf is an enemy of [[Delton]] and none dared questioned the ruling with the irrefutable evidence. After my speech, I formed a mob of townsfolk and hired mercenaries to hunt down the elves. I took the elves as slaves and slaughtered all those foolish enough to oppose me. 
> 
>During my reign, I stopped hiring the townspeople to work in my mines and plantation. After the raid, I used gnome slaves to work in my coal mines and elf slaves on my tobacco farm. I had a wonderful human wife named [[Maria Von Marrow]], and twin sons named [[Vernan Von Marrow]] and [[Shaun Von Marrow]]. I met my wife Maria when I was 20. She was an assassin that was hired by the families of the elvish slaves. Many families of the elvish slaves sent assassins before, but they were amateurs at best. She was different. She was the first assassin to enter my manor and get past my guards. It was the first time I knew fear. Her skills with a rapier were unmatched. The fight lasted hours, only ending after I doubled the offer of my bounty. I hired her as my personal bodyguard but only a short time after we fell in love. Despite how different we were, I always loved her. She was from the slums of [[Sebeth, The City Of Twilight]] and was raised by a group of assassins known as the Order of [[The Black Sons]]. She was always kind to animals, but sadistic when it came to people (especially slaves). She always criticized my hunts, despite liberally using my slaves as target practice. 
>
>My wife gave birth to twin boys named Vernan and Shaun. My sons are now seventeen years old. Shaun was a timid but academic genius, while Vernan was a troublesome brute. Vernan was always causing trouble for the townsfolk. Much like my father, I was never there much for their childhood, but I always berated them with gifts as much as I could. 
>
> I kept hearing rumors that there were demons in the nearby forest kidnapping travelers. They described the creature as a human skeleton with boney, bat-like wings, a long tail, and glowing blue eyes. It was twice the size of a man. They called the creature [[Dagna, the Beast of Delton]]. I dismissed the claims as mere superstition and attributed the disappearances to bandits. My quick dismissal of these claims was my downfall. Our village was raided in the middle of the night by the army of the Thay. I was awakened by the screams of the villagers and the roaring flames of the buildings. I ran looking for my wife and children and attempted to escape. [[The Thay]] were abducting everyone in my village, including my family and slaves. 
> 
>I sent my son Shaun with a wandering merchant named [[Beckett Goldtongue]], narrowly escaping the raid. As I ran towards the village, I was met with a chilling gaze of two bright blue eyes. It was Dagna. The beast struck me and sent me flying into the pub. Before falling unconscious, I heard the faint laughter emitting from that demon spawn. During the raid, the Thay took most of my wealth, though some still remain in hidden safes in the estate. 
>
>I was kept in the same cell as my loving wife Maria but never knew what truly happened to my son Vernan. I and my family were tortured and used as test subjects for magical experimentation for roughly a decade. The lead researcher [[Zerack The Whispered Omen]] was relentless and was especially brutal to me and my wife. He was an Elvish member of the Thay from somewhere in the [[Elvendark jungle]] . He killed and reanimated me for ten years, with each death being more cruel than the last. Incineration, flaying, and poisons were some of the deaths I experienced. Every day he found new ways to kill me. Every Time I was revived, I was not restored to perfect health. He’d purposely regenerate me without muscles, patches of skin,, and sometimes eyes. As I grew more deformed, my wife started to become afraid of me and how I looked. He saw what he was doing was justified, just because I forced his elvish wife to work to death on my farm. The Thay finally achieved their goal with me by creating one of the first skeletons with consciousness. They made me in hopes to make the perfect undead general, however, I showed to be mentally unstable after the torture.  As I was not competent enough to lead an army, I was forced to guard the very prison that kept me captive.
>
>My wife did not survive long after the experiments, as she failed to reanimate with consciousness after her seventh death. Zerach grasped her arm, causing her skin to start rotting. I yelled and pleaded with him, but he wouldn't stop. After 5 minutes her flailing around she was nothing more than ash. He made me watch every second.
>
>After four years of planning, I decided to make my great escape. After patrolling the tower as a guard, I mapped every nook and cranny of the building. When the night came I released every human prisoner knowing that they would certainly perish without stepping a foot outside the tower. It mattered not. They were no more than a distraction when I made my way to the sewer system. From there I found an opening near the stables. I stole an undead horse and went North to a nearby human village named [[Tudor]]. An old human mage named [[Stug]] sheltered me. He felt pity for me as he once worked under Thay himself and was looking to find a way to make amends for what he did in his past. When I first met him, I tried cutting his tongue with a steak knife. He was so sick and frail that he could barely resist. The only thing that stopped me was seeing the old man weep. He told me that after joining the Thay, the Thay killed his family after refusing to kill innocent children for a sacrifice. He wanted to assist me in any way he could to make amends for his past actions. I felt sympathetic to the old man and decided to stay with him temporarily. I helped him out with his small farm and in turn, he taught me how to commune with the dead and summon apparitions of lost souls. He told me that I needed an object that was once owned by the deceased in order to summon the apparition. I attempted to use a lock of my wife’s hair as a conduit for the ritual. When I first summoned an apparition, the figure that I saw before me was no other than my dear Maria. The view before me staggered my very soul. I wept black ichor from open optic canals as I remembered the events from that forsaken mage tower. This is when I vowed to destroy every member of the Thay. After training with Stug for a year, I began the search to find my children. I hope to one day I can pay back Stug for all that he's done for me. 
>
>My insanity only grew after leaving my prison. I started to speak to my echo as it was the only being willing to talk to him like he was still alive. I was an abomination before the very gods. After losing my wealth, my home, and my family greed corrupted my soul. I lost everything that made me noble. I steal and take as much as I can in the hope of funding an expedition to find my children. Maybe one day I can give them a gift large enough to make up for being an embarrassment of a father.
>
>I used to come to small villages extorting the people of their money and valuables, claiming it was my tax. These villages were far from my de jure lands. I would continue to do this until the villages rebelled against him or hired mercenaries to deal with me. Despite no longer having a stomach, I still practice my avid love of hunting. Not having a stomach for years makes you build up quite the appetite. At one point I lived in a forest to avoid confrontation with people. I always missed my flesh, as everything feels so cold. I collected hairs off of corpses to build a mustache that was similar to the one I had when I was still living.
> 
>I've developed a huge resentment for wizards and other spell casters. I was infamous in many regions for hunting down exclusively the Thay for bounties. After every bounty, I collected their tongues. My first hunt was the most invigorating. I heard word of a member of the Thay skulking by a graveyard of a small village. After tracking down the spellfag I realized it was just 19-year-old boy [[Nathenial]]. After closer inspection, his clothes and marking seemed authentic. Despite him being nothing more than a buffoon who had no real potential for magic, he was a member of the Thay. I decided to rope his hands together and told him if he walk longer than I could without stopping, I’d let him live. This was before he knew I was undead. We walked for 30 miles straight before he collapsed to the ground. I unveiled my hood to show him my skeletal figure. I smited the little bastard and threw his tongue in a bag. 
>
>After the raid, I mastered the shadows and became a legend.
