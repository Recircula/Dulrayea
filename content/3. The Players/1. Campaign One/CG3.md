## Backstory:
%%
C.G.3 was found nearly destroyed and nonfunctional in the [[The Daqha Desert]] by an elven Artificer named [[Ludwig Strauss]]. Ludwig immediately saw the value and potential of being in possession of a son of Cyr so he decided to haul the metal corpse back to his home of [[Ironvale]]. Spending all his time and resources into fixing C.G.3 he finally fixed him up to being functional again. C.G.3 awakens for the first time in years unsure of where he is only to be greeted by Ludwig asking all sorts of questions about C.G.3s past, However, C.G.3 didn't have any answers. 

He couldn't remember anything before this moment. Why was he here? What was his purpose? What was I? Who am i? All these questions rushed through his head. Ludwig then decided to give C.G.3 a purpose. Ludwig took him under his wing and started teaching C.G.3 everything he knew to help him be able to maintain himself. CG started watching Ludwig do commissions for the townspeople and it really interested him to see how things worked and were put together. So he eventually asked Ludwig to teach him and let him work on small things. CG started with little things like fixing old heirlooms for people. Always pushing deadlines on commissions CG learned got his work ethic and determination from working with Ludwig. Eventually, CG got fed up with little things and, against Ludwig's wishes, worked on a gun that needed to be repaired. Ludwig caught him and was initially mad but saw the fine workmanship and started letting him help on his bigger projects. After working on a bunch of different guns and learning how they work inside and out, CG wanted to show Ludwig how far he's come and decided to start making his own gun from scratch. [[Anya Strauss]] would always bring him some oil and even force him to take some breaks from work. “Work too hard and you'll overheat, ya gearhead” Anya would tell him. CG would learn to relax and enjoy the little things from anya. After a week of working CG showed Ludwig his work and CG will never forget how proud Ludwig looked. Anya would often talk about her mother and how much she loved her and missed her. But Ludwig never really mentioned anything about it or bring her up at all. So one day CG decided to ask him and Ludwig told Cg that his wife, Ada, passed a couple of years prior to finding him. 

She contracted some sort of sickness that Ludwig had never seen before. Ludwig spent all his time trying to find something or make something to help get rid of this sickness. While he was able to slow it a little bit he unfortunately wasn’t able to stop it from taking her life. Ludwig and Anya were devastated by her death and cg thinks this is why they kept him around to fill that empty space in their hearts. Ludwig acted as a mentor not only in craft but also in life. Cg really looked up to Ludwig’s outlook on life on how family comes first and there’s nothing you shouldn’t do to help the ones you love. One thing that stuck with cg is Ludwig’s saying “There’s nothing that can’t be fixed” and I think Cg is really taking this advice to heart currently. 

CG would see letters from [[The Seekers]] but he didn't know who or what that meant. C.G.3 started to care for Ludwig and his daughter Anya. One of his favorite things was going to the market with Anya to get supplies for Ludwig and weekly groceries. Anya would describe the smells of all the food and fresh baked goods to CG. He would even spend time learning to cook with Anya. The nights in the kitchen laughing, throwing food, arguing over little things like measurements, and singing Anya's favorite songs made CG truly happy.

Ludwig basically taught cg3 everything he knows about tinkering. Cg would always help out with random commissions and loved learning new things from Ludwig. Ludwig was more than a tinkerer though, he also loved the performing arts and music and would always take cg and Anya to all sorts of plays and concerts. Anya was always singing and dreamed of becoming a singer because of this. She would always get cg to sit and listen while she would practice and throw “concerts” at home. Cg would build little stages and lights to make it feel like a real experience for her. And no matter what new songs she learned she’d always sing her favorite song “Solitude”. Cg always would love hearing her sing and to this day still hears her voice singing I’m his head and even hums it while working on his different tools and items. Ludwig and Anya also once threw a surprise “birthday” party for cg which they would celebrate on the day they booted him back up. Ludwig gave Cg his very own set of tools which he uses to this day. And Anya gave cg his bandana which she made herself. They spent the day having a picnic outside in the sun, Ludwig even telling Cg that he’s like a son to him now. 

CG's fondest memory however is the day when Ludwig took Anya and CG to the markets of Pilferwall.CG had never seen such a sight. So many different people and stores. He was dumbstruck till Anya dragged him around the stalls. CG will never forget Anya's smile and laugh as she pulled him through the sea of people. It was a beautiful trip to them, but to Ludwig, it was for business to see the seekers.

One day CG and Anya were walking home from getting some groceries when a couple of thugs cornered them. CG was fine giving them money for no trouble until one of them said “We want her too '' and pointed at Anya. CG snapped as soon as he heard that. CG would never let anything hurt his family. He took out all three of the thugs and was then approached by a Human who liked how CG Handled himself. The man said his name was [[Clint Cross]] and asked where CG was from. CG replied “I don't know this place is all I can remember''. “Well if you're lost i got a place for you,” said Clint. 

That place was a group called [[The Band Of Exiles]] and CG decided to join so he could start helping out with money and to learn how he could get stronger to protect his family. He was brought before the leader of the band, [[Lord Grundath]], and his two hands [[Alyana]] and [[Moth The Left Hand]]. Their presence alone was enough to make CG nervous and could tell these aren't people to fuck with. They told him that there was no going back and that once you join the band you're there forever. They pulled out the brand and asked where he wanted it. CG nervously looked at Clint, but Clint gave him a nod to reassure him. CG chose the back of his right shoulder. They stuck the brand on his metal body and CG tried his hardest to hold his pain in but couldn't do it for long and let out a loud yell. When Cg got back up they all erupted in celebration. “You tough son of a bitch how'd you hold it in that long” as he pulled him in for a hug. He was paired up with Clint Cross who was known in the band for his marksmanship. C.G.3 was Clint's shadow and watched every move and practiced mimicking him. C.G.3 had a knack for shooting and would tinker with new gadgets and weapons to give him an edge.Cg3 had his first mission with Clint and it was easy. They were acting as muscle for a local tavern. The two mainly sat outside and talked and got to know each other better. Clint didn’t really take the job seriously so he would just have fun around the tavern and show cg how to “enjoy the little things”. After many drinks, Clint started picking a fight with some big rowdy orcs. Cg tried to calm the situation down but one of the orcs threw a punch. The whole bar erupted as cg and Clint eventually took down these rowdy orcs. Clint realized he found a partner he could work with to have his back. One job they did was a snatch-and-grab job. They had to break into a person who owed the band money from a job they did and refused to pay. It seemed too easy there was no one at the house and the money was just sitting there on the table. Clint knowing better noticed someone sneaking up from behind them and pushed cg out of the way taking a bullet for him. Another mission the two went on was a protection job. They were sent to guard a VIP in [[Pilferwall]] and of course, cg kept asking questions but Clint taught him that most of the time the less you know the better you’ll sleep. Cg took this advice to heart and tried to stay away from the whys and who’s of the missions. But this protection mission ended up being an ambush to take out some band of exiles members. Cg and Clint found themselves and their whole squad surrounded as the supposed VIP lured them into a trap. Watching all their friends get slaughtered, CG went on a rampage and he and Clint committed a blood bath. 

The two emerged as the only survivors surrounded by corpses of friends and foes. The two then had become more than friends after this. They became survivors. Brothers. The two would often do stuff outside of missions such as go to bars so Clint could teach cg how to pick up women. Clint would always say “Only things that make life worth living are booze and bitches”. The two would often get competitive keeping track of who had more kills on missions to even racing on horseback to see who could get somewhere faster. Clint would always tell cg about getting a “big fucking house in a huge fucking city with a woman with big fucking tits” It would always make cg laugh but he said he’d help him get there someday no matter what. He had no qualms with the more morally gray areas of the job, that is until a specific mission. It was a normal bounty job put out on an enemy of the band.

CG was told that it was someone who had connections with the Seekers. CG didn't make the connection until we arrived at Ludwig's house. C.G.3 was confused and thought no way this is happening, Ludwig has never done anything wrong. Clint and the Three others with them kicked down the door and had them at gunpoint. C.G.3 knew that in this moment, this split-second decision no matter the choice, his life would change drastically. C.G.3 opened fire on his partners while yelling at Ludwig and Anya to leave. Only two were left standing, C.G.3 and Clint. Ludwig and Anya escaped and his former comrades and friends dead. They both open fire and C.G.3 takes a shot to the body. Not being able to kill his closest friend, he aimed for Clint's arms and legs. C.G.3 stumbled up to Clint disabled on the floor and picked up his cowboy hat and put it on and continued to walk off. Clint yelled, “COME BACK HERE AND FINISH ME OFF LIKE THE OTHERS, YOU TRAITOR.” C.G.3 left hoping Clint would understand the situation. C.G.3 felt angry, frustrated, and most importantly sad. If only Machines could cry. C.G.3 once again lost in life, wandering, a lone desperado. He wanders in hopes of finding Ludwig and Anya or anything leading to his past. But more than anything he wishes to return to his life before that dreadful day. CG went to Pilferwall in hopes to find Ludwig and Anya there with the seekers but being part of the band complicated things. CG couldn't directly ask around so he decided to stake out and search the town for clues. One day CG was tailing a Seeker and overheard that they had moved 2 Elves to a safe house to the east but before they said the city they had gone inside a building and CG was unable to hear. CG headed east stopping through [[Hexadale]], [[Final Sanity]], to eventually the [[Crimson Palisades]]. Cg was filled with dread, anxiety, anger, and depression not knowing if his family had survived or if he would survive the band hunted him to even see them again if they were alive. Cg would take missions to keep his mind off things and make some money for survival.
