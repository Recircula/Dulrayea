$$\text{Welcome:}$$
**Welcome to a world of magic and mystery, where ancient forces are stirring, and a great war is looming on the horizon. Old cities and races that were long thought to be forgotten are beginning to reappear, and a new source of magic, known only as the Void, is emerging from the shadows. As the world braces for war, the greatest threat may come from the rebirth of the great ancient dragons, powerful beasts that have been slumbering for centuries. Their awakening has brought a sense of awe and wonders to many, but others fear the chaos and destruction that they could unleash.**

**In addition to the return of the dragons, something sinister is also stirring in the abyss. A dark and malevolent force is slowly crawling out of the shadows, seeking revenge for a past wrong that has long been forgotten by all but a select few.**

**As these ancient forces begin to converge, the world is thrown into chaos and uncertainty. Kingdoms and empires prepare for war, while the common people struggle to survive in a world that seems to be teetering on the edge of destruction.**

**Amidst all the turmoil, there are those who seek to understand the Void, harness its power, and unlock its secrets. They believe that it may hold the key to saving the world from destruction, but they must tread carefully, for the power of the Void is unpredictable and dangerous.**

**Welcome to a world on the brink of war, where ancient powers are stirring and new threats are emerging. The fate of the world rests in the hands of those brave enough to face these challenges head-on, and the coming days will test the courage and resolve of all who call this world home.**

>> [!recite|text-Center bg-c-purple]- Author!
>> Greetings to all who share a love for the art of storytelling. My name is [[Logan]], a dedicated author deeply engaged in the enchanting world of fantasy literature. My journey commenced with the wondrous tales of J.R.R. Tolkien, specifically "The Lord of the Rings." The rich landscapes, like the Misty Mountains, and the vibrant characters, like Tom Bombadil, ignited my imagination and fostered a lifelong affection for the genre. At nine, I discovered "Dungeons & Dragons," a pivotal moment that shaped my identity and perception of narrative art. This tabletop role-playing game transcended its recreational purpose, opening a gateway to a realm of boundless creativity and endless possibilities. It captured my heart and became an integral part of who I am, influencing my understanding and love for storytelling.
>> 
>> Throughout my life, especially during challenging times of introspection and battles with depression, "Dungeons & Dragons" has been a source of comfort and resilience. It offered not only escape but also a connection to a community of kindred spirits, underscoring the healing power of shared stories. 
>> 
>> Presently, I am devoted to "The Waking Realms," my most ambitious project yet, cultivated over five years. It is an endeavor to craft an immersive world for others to explore, drawing inspiration from Tolkien's Middle-earth and the dynamic universe of D&D. "The Waking Realms" is a vast universe, filled with new systems, lore, narratives, factions, magical elements, and items. It promises perpetual discovery for Dungeon Masters and players alike. This project is more than a hobby; it's a testament to my dedication to fantasy storytelling. "The Waking Realms" is not just a personal passion; it's my legacy, contributing significantly to the realm of fantasy literature and interactive storytelling.
>> 
>> I am grateful to everyone who has joined me on this extraordinary journey. As I continue to develop and expand "The Waking Realms," I invite you to be part of this adventure. Together, we will explore the realms of imagination, and I hope this project becomes a sanctuary for those seeking adventure, excitement, and a deep engagement in an evolving world of fantasy.
