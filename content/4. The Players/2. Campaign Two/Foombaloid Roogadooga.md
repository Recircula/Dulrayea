## Backstory
A long distance east from [[Sebeth, The City Of Twilight]], there was a small village with a low population and it wasn't by any means well known. This village was named [[Pinehaven]], due to its main source of money being made off of exporting lumber. In Pinehaven, bandits were a relatively common sight, normally coming once a month, due to there not being much security or many strong people in the village. They usually only ask for tribute from village members, but they will steal things that catch their eye, and anyone who stands in their way or refuses or is not able to pay tribute is either held prisoner or executed on the spot, depending on the level of their actions. One day, there was a cleric who was devoted to Talos, to whom there was a small church for in the village. This cleric's name was [[Wilhelm Cantell]]. He was from the village and was coming back from selling wood, when he came across a wagon that hit a tree, which some tracks on the ground showed that the wagon was run off the road by a family of bears, and both the owner and horse had run away, although a long blood trail along with a trail of claw marks coming from the back of the wagon made it seem that the owner's escape was highly unlikely. There wasn't much in the wagon, except for a pile of straw, and when he dug through the pile, there was a large, shiny egg nestled in the straw. Given the fact that the person who had the egg, presumably a parent, was gone, he decided to take and care for the egg. When he got back, he started taking care of the egg alongside his normal activities. 

After a few months, the egg hatched, giving way for a copper dragonborn, who Wilhelm named Foombaloid Roogadooga, due to those words randomly coming to him in a dream the previous night. Foombaloid grew up without any real friends aside from Wilhelm, who took care of him. He took an interest in Talos at a young age, mainly because he grew up around a Talos-devoted cleric, but he also was interested because of the fact that both Foombaloid Roogadooga and Talos had lightning-based abilities. Wilhelm gave Foombaloid Roogadooga a basic education himself, which he had done well enough to get most of it through Foombaloid Roogadooga's relatively unintelligent head. Seeing people get raided and occasionally killed by bandits filled Foombaloid Roogadooga with hate towards them, and around when he was 10 years old, he asked Wilhelm why no one stood up to them. He was told that no one in the village was strong enough to. After hearing this, Foombaloid Roogadooga said that he wanted to get stronger so he could help the people who needed it. Wilhelm had heard on one of his wood-selling trips that there was a man in the capital of Sebeth who was training people to become paladins in the name of Talos, and so he decided to give him the option of going to Sebeth to become a paladin of Talos, so he could make his wish come true. Although reluctant to leave the only person he has really ever known, he decided to take him up on his offer so that he could help the village with its bandit problem. After a while of traveling, Foombaloid Roogadooga made it into Sebeth and said goodbye to Wilhelm, promising that he would return. 

Although it took some searching, eventually Foombaloid Roogadooga found the man who he had been told about, the Talos paladin named [[Foul Hammer]], who he then asked to train him. Foul Hammer agreed, and trained Foombaloid Roogadooga under him. When he started his training, he had average skill, but he was pretty strong for his age. He also stuck to the paladin code well, and he was kind and helpful to others. Over time, his skill and strength grew, and he became a very strong paladin. Throughout his training, Foul Hammer had taken a liking to him, and they became friends with each other, and when Foombaloid Roogadooga told him his reasons for becoming a paladin, Foul Hammer asked a difficult question: "If you had to choose between saving family, or saving friends, which would you choose?" This question was hard not only because it was difficult to choose between the two options, but also because he never really had much experience with either. He only had one person he considered family, being Wilhelm, and one person he considered a friend, being Foul Hammer. He doesn't want to have to choose one or the other, so his choice was that he would save everyone he could, whether they be family, friends, or innocent strangers. He said that he would be willing to put his life on the line if he had to, if it meant he could save everyone without having to choose.

Closer to the end of his training, Foul Hammer asked Foombaloid Roogadooga if he had ever been betrayed before, to which he said that he hadn't Foul Hammer then told him about the horrible feeling of betrayal, and how he wished it never happens to him, and how no man should ever have to feel betrayed. When Foombaloid Roogadooga asked what made him feel betrayed, Foul Hammer told him about a horrible event that happened a long time ago in Sebeth called "The Weeping Souls, " which Foul Hammer was a part of, and how it was a tragic event that left Foul Hammer mentally scarred, due to both him being betrayed by the people that he trusted and losing part of his family. He then explained how it led him to serving under Talos as a paladin instead of the All-Father, and how it helped him get through the tough times that he was having. 

Once Foombaloid Roogadooga finished his training, he was 18 years old, and he left Sebeth to return to Pinehaven. However, once he returned, he couldn't find Wilhelm anywhere, and his house had been robbed of everything valuable that it had, which led him to believe that Wilhelm had been either captured or killed by the bandits. He asked around town to find out what happened, and eventually he found a priest for the church that knew. The priest said that Wilhelm had been taken as a prisoner by the bandits for trying to protect someone who was being beaten by the bandits for not being able to pay tribute, and in return for acting against them, he had to pay for the other person and then be imprisoned. Relieved to know that he hadn't been killed, he was still mad about what had happened. Foombaloid Roogadooga decided that he would raid the bandit camp. He knew where it was, and had new strength that he had obtained through years of training. He asked around town to try and recruit anyone who would be willing to fight, but no one wanted to go with him, and most people tried to advise him not to go, but he decided he would go alone and went anyway. He had been careful who he asked, as to not accidentally let a bandit know of his plan, so they didn't know that he was coming. 

The camp was in thick woods, surrounded by large, tall trees, and so he had plenty of cover to sneak through and high vantage points to scout from. He silently snuck through the woods toward the camp, and he climbed a tree to scout out the camp, and to find where the camp's prison was. He had done so flawlessly, and he had still not been spotted. The camp was large, and there were many bandits. It consisted of a large main building, which he saw had the prison, and he and the bandit leader's room, and the treasury next to it, a few barracks buildings, and a few other, less important buildings, all surrounded by a tall stone fence, with three heavily guarded main entrances. He noticed that the main building was made of stone, and almost the entire rest of the camp consisted of wooden buildings, so the thought of burning it down crossed his mind, but he decided against it because burning is an inhumane way to kill somebody, and the surrounding forest is a massive fire hazard. He knew that he couldn't sneak through the camp because of his larger size and clank armor, so he prepared to fight. His plan was to take down the leader in hopes that it would make the other bandits give up, and he wanted to try and do this with as little killing as possible. While he was looking for ways in, he saw a spot near the main building where there was a tree right outside of the fence that he could climb to jump across the fence. The fence was tall, but he believed that he could stick the landing if he did it right. 

Once he had his plan, he snuck around, and made his way in. Although the height he had to jump from was higher than he thought, and in reality it was about 11 feet high, he stuck the landing, although it made a loud noise. He heard a single bandit coming to investigate, and so he hid behind some old crates that were scattered around, and stealthily knocked out the bandit. He searched his body, and he found a key to the main building, which he entered with the key through a nearby door. There weren't too many guards in the halls, as most were outside, so he managed to get by, only needing to take down a few guards before he reached the prison. Inside, there were a bunch of cells, and in one of them, he found Wilhelm. However, Wilhelm had been severely beaten. In fact, he realized that it wasn't just Wilhelm, but all of the prisoners had been nearly beaten to death. Wilhelm was happy to see him, but feared what would happen if he got caught, so he told him to leave. However, as Foombaloid Roogadooga saw the state of Wilhelm and the prisoners and how they were treated, he was filled with rage the likes of which he had never felt before. He started sparkling with electricity, and although at first he thought he was just seeing things, the electricity started to change from blue to red, and he started furiously marching towards the leader's room. He managed to take down every guard in his path in one or two hits, with no care for their life. Once he reached the bandit leader's room, he kicked down the door, and the bandit leader was surprised to see that someone was about to attack him. 

The leader grabbed a nearby sword and went to swing it, but Foombaloid Roogadooga swung his Hammer and knocked it out of his hands. The leader realized just what he was dealing with and, filled with fear, started pleading for his life. Without any words, Foombaloid Roogadooga knocked him to the ground with one swing and went for another, but as he was about to kill him, he realized what he was about to do and that his emotions and rage had overcome him. He started to calm down, and the red electricity turned back to blue before disappearing altogether. Seeing as the leader was injured and terrified of him, he decided that he had done enough and went to a window and shouted that he had defeated their leader and that he ordered them to give up. The bandits were surprised and scared at the fact that the leader had been beaten, and so they either surrendered or ran. After that, he took the treasury and prison keys from the leader and went to the prison, where he released all of the prisoners and locked up all of the remaining bandits. He then went to the treasury and loaded all of the treasure onto a cart, and he and the freed prisoners took horses and carts and returned home. Once he got back, he went to the head of the village about the imprisoned bandits and the bandit camp, and how they had to be taken care of and that the camp was now free for use. He then turned over the stolen treasure, but the head insisted that he should take a portion for himself because of what he had done. Now that he was finally back home with Wilhelm and free of the bandits that he had long wanted to get rid of, he was happy.

Two years later, he thought that it might be time to go travel and help people other than just the people in Pinehaven. He asked Wilhelm for ideas of where to go to find work and maybe new friends, and Wilhelm suggested that he should just go back to Sebeth, but Foombaloid Roogadooga said that he had seen enough of Sebeth, and wanted to explore and see new places, and then he recommended that he should go to the [[Crimson Palisades]], because he heard that it was a nice city and he believed that there should be plenty of work there for him. Foombaloid Roogadooga thought that this was a good idea, and he left for the Crimson Palisade after a few days of getting ready and saying goodbye to the people he knew. Nothing much happened on his way there, and he got there after a few weeks of travel without anything happening to him. 

Once he entered the city, he decided to look for a place to stay for a while, but didn't have too much money because he had spent a decent amount on food and other things that he needed, so he decided that he would stay at a cheap inn for a while. After a couple days of exploring the city, he decided that he should join the local adventurers guild and start doing quests so that he could make money. The main quests that he would do were ones where people were in danger and had to be helped or ones where there was someone dangerous who had to be taken down, like bandits. One day during his stay, he decided that he wanted to study dragons and things and events related to them, seeing as he was descended from them. He learned many things about dragons, and after he did some things, he found out that he was descended from platinum dragons, which he thought was really cool, but he didn't really know what to do with that information.

For the next two years of his life, he lived in the Crimson Palisade, going on adventures and helping people in need. One day, close to the end of his stay, he went into a tavern to have a drink. After a few minutes, a half-elf walked in and started talking to random people and asking questions. Eventually, he walked over to Foombaloid Roogadooga and said "You look funny, can you answer a question?" Confused, Foombaloid Roogadooga said that he might. The half-elf then asked "Do you know where a man named [[Castion Ember]] is?" Foombaloid Roogadooga said that he didn't, but he wanted to know who he was. The half-elf said that it was his father , and he was searching for him and heard that he was here. Foombaloid Roogadooga said that he wasn't really doing much here that he couldn't do anywhere and he had seen enough of the city anyways , so he could go with him and help on his search. The half-elf said that would be nice, and then Foombaloid Roogadooga asked for his name. The half-elf replied "Allamir's the name, Kriben's the game." After [[Allamir Kriben (Deceased)]] asked around a little more, they left the tavern, and In a couple of hours they became good friends.
