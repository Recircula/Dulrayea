>> #### Family
>>   Ennarka was born into the Order of the Mindful Eyes, fathered by an Order Hunter, Verak Swiftsword, and mothered by an Order Cook, Sina Woodgate, whom Verak saved while on the trail of an artifact and brought into the fold of the Order for her protection. Ennarka is their second child, their first being a boy named Bellam, who was seven at the time of Ennarka’s birth.
>>    
>>   Verak is an ardent member of the Order, and as such insisted on strictly following Order tradition with both children. With much convincing, and great reluctance on her part, Sina agreed. Once Bellam was weaned off her milk and was able to walk with sure footing, he was taken by the Order for general training and teaching. Sina, however, had not grown up within the walls of the Order and did not hold the reverence for its traditions and ways her beloved husband did. And as such only really intended to follow them as much as she could get away with. So, when Bellam was around five and she could trust him to keep a secret, she found him at a time when he was alone from his carers and told him who she was, and what he was to her, and that she very much loved him so, and always would (though she would never reveal who his father was, out of respect for her husband and his wish to adhere to Order tradition). And so it went for the next few years that Bellam would twice a week, sneak out to the cooks’ quarters and rendezvous with his mother, who would tell him stories and legends her parents told her, and cook small meals for the boy. 
>>   
>>   This would go even into the first trimester of her second pregnancy, and he would be introduced to his younger brother Ennarka. These secret maternal meetings could not continue beyond that as she could no longer reside in the cooks’ quarters beyond her first trimester and had midwives caring for her in the maternal ward. And so, Bellam went headfirst into his mental and martial training, to become an agent of the Order who could protect his mom and new brother. 
>>   
>>   #### The Birth and Young Life of Ennarka:
>>   As previously stated, Ennarka is the second son of Order Hunter Verak Swiftsword, and Order Cook Sina Woodgate. He was born small and sickly. Oftentimes it was wondered by physician and mother alike whether he would survive his infancy or not. Verak would only visit rarely, and while the midwives would viciously gossip about his apparent apathy, Sina took no offense. She knew that he was simply scared that his son may not live to receive a second name. Ennarka eventually did survive through his eighteenth month, and though he was still weak and smaller than most, the physicians of the order believed he had a greater chance of surviving than dying for now. The maternal ward declared it a great miracle. However, the gods do not often give miracles freely. 
>>   
>>   Not soon after Ennarka started his upward trend of health, his mother Sina’s went into swift decline. Some say it was the stress of nursing a sickly baby, some say it was the very sickness her newborn bore. Regardless of reason or blame, Sina would not live to see her second son turn three. 
>>   
>>   After her death and burial, the Order had a decision to make. There was now a young toddler, not yet three, with no caretaker. A toddler who was small and weak, so much so it was doubtful he could endure the trials and tribulations required for induction into the Order. The Order wasn’t even sure he would be of use as a farmer or cook, such was his physical state. A ward who would be nothing but a burden on the Order, who value utility above all. Bellam, age ten, knew what this would mean. He would be cast out into the wilderness, his fate left to the gods and devils of the world. He could not let it happen. 
>>   
>>   So, young Bellam, at an age where his training was in a far more independent curriculum in order to ascertain which faction he and his peers would be assigned to, snuck away during the day and found his way to the entrance of the Council of Three. Nobody beyond the four of them knows what was discussed there, whether Bellam revealed his knowledge of their familial connection or not. But the outcome was the decree that Young Bellam would have until he would enter an apprenticeship at thirteen to train and raise Ennarka into a child befitting induction into the Order. He would do it with no help from Order Instructors and while keeping up with his own training. The Order would not tolerate any burden to their operation. 
>>   
>>   For the next three years Bellam barely slept, training in the day and acting as instructor for his brother into the night. While he pushed both himself and his brother to their limits, he was always sure to never be cruel in doing so. He wished for him to be strong to survive, but he also wished to show him the kindness of their mother in her stead. And so over these three years eating, sweating, and learning together, the brothers forged an inseparable bond. 
>>   
>>   On the day Bellam was to be given a caste and a master to study under, Ennarka, age six, was also slated to be given a special mental and physical test to serve as proof he was capable enough to be of use to the order. He knew he must pass, or else he would never be able to see his older brother again, and would likely mean some sort of punishment for Bellam as well. He was still a fairly weak child, but he was not so frail anymore, and Bellam had honed his mind, taught him to be quite clever and calculating. Any test of strength he managed to outwit, and passed the trials with relative ease. And so as Ennarka was finally welcomed into the Order, his brother was accepted into the Hunter caste and assigned a master. Bellam would be leaving, as all hunters must, and training as an apprentice. They would no longer see each other every night, laughing and suffering through training together, as brothers. But the bond they had created would only strengthen over time, and Bellam would never fail to spend the lion’s share of his time back within the Order’s walls with his beloved brother. 
>>   
>>   #### Adolescence and Apprenticeship 
>>   Ennarka fit well with his peers while training as a boy. He wasn’t boisterous, or even incredibly social, but he was quiet and showed kindness to his fellow students. And though he was never among the best in martial training, he was an astute learner and showed a thirst to always know more, which was a pleasure to his instructors. Meanwhile Bellam had been making a name for himself as an excellent hunter’s apprentice, receiving the second name Balehound for his often-relentless attitude, especially when hunting down those the Order considered dangerous or enemies.
>>   
>>   At thirteen, Ennarka was chosen to join the Enquirers for his force of will, soft-spoken, yet clever demeanor, and overall curiosity for learning. His master found that he was quite adept at dealing with the sentient artifacts in their care. Sentient objects were always trying to seduce Enquirers with power, wealth, comfort. Always trying to strike deals or enable escape in return for the enquirer's wildest dreams. Gleaning any relevant research or information out of them without giving them anything in return was a nigh impossible task for any but the shrewdest and most discerning of Enquirers. It was Ennarka’s silver tongue and clever mind that allowed him to do just that, and earned him the second name of Voidseeker.
>>   
>>   #### Betraying the Order
>>   Ennarka was twenty and had been living well within the Order, making a name for himself as a skilled Enquirer, even earning the approval of the Councilman of the Enquirers: Piyar Devilchain. He got regular visits from his brother after every hunt, and though Bellam and he had to keep this familial bond secret or risk expulsion from the Order, they would not hide that they were the closest of friends. One morning Bellam arrived at his quarters early in the morning, looking more grim than Ennarka had ever seen him. It worried Ennarka, his brother had always been so strong and upbeat, even in those grueling days of training as children. To look so sullen so openly, something must have been horribly wrong. He invited him in, and that which weighed on Bellam’s mind came spilling forth. 
>>   
>>   > [!quote|author] 
>>   > “There is an artifact within the order, brother, I am not sure exactly what, the Council refuses to say. All I know is that its sentient, and the Council will keep it under wraps by any means necessary... and that, in order to keep it sated and restrained, the Council has been sacrificing one member of the Order to it every ten years.” 
>> 
>> At that point Bellam could not look his brother in the eye and Ennarka knew what came next.
>>   
>>   “A lottery has been held, as it apparently has every ten years, and I have been chosen, brother, to be the newest sacrifice.” 
>>   
>>   Ennarka’s mind immediately spun, it felt like the ground would give way beneath him. The Order would do such a thing? To his brother of all people, who served so nobly? But not a second later his mind raced with solutions, and he started thinking out loud. “We could run Bellam, run to where the Order might never find us. Ah! Or better yet, we could go to the Council, perhaps suggest sourcing criminals from a nearby kingdom-,” 
>>   
>>   Bellam cut him off with a sudden, tight hug. It told Ennarka everything he had been dreading to hear. His brother, noble fool he is, would not run from his duty and would not entertain the Order committing such an evil as to take the lives of outsiders for detaining an artifact. 
>>   
>>   “I am not afraid to give my life for the Order and the greater good we strive for. In fact, I am more than proud to do so. I did not come here to scheme, brother, but to allow us both the small luxury of saying goodbye to our only family. It is one the rest of the Order does not get. Cherish it and survive me by bringing the Order one step closer to thwarting the Evils beyond our world through your skills as an Enquirer. I must prepare now, brother. My final duty is to be done at midnight. I love you, Ennarka,” 
>>   
>>   And with those final words to his brother, and a tight squeeze, he disappeared before Ennarka could react, leaving him reeling with the void of the news and his own sinking gut. He could not stand for this. Would not. Bellam was his brother, the very reason he was alive today. And in the silence and whirlwind of emotions, he made up his mind. He would return the favor; he would save his brother. He would take the artifact and run, after all, he cannot be sacrificed to it if it is no longer there. It's risky and likely suicidal, and even if he succeeds, the Order will likely hunt him for what might remain of his life. But all of that was better than the thought of his brother dying. 
>>   
>>   So Ennarka got to work, sneaking into the Archive of the Curators to find what exactly this artifact was and where it was being held. Searching was not nearly as hard as he had thought it might be, he had read almost half of the records already in his spare time. After five hours of scouring, he found what he had been looking for, records on an artifact with sentience that required human sacrifice. Though it was incomplete, it did not state what exactly this artifact was or why it needed to be sacrificed in order to keep it contained. It was likely that that information was only passed down from relevant enquirer to enquirer as they got an apprentice. Though this did not matter. To Ennarka, it could hold the darkest of gods and the very destruction of half the world, and he would still do what he must now.
>>   
>>   And so Ennarka stalked the ward it was held in, waited until Curator guards were switching shifts, and used the few second window to sneak himself in. It was an austere stone room, akin more to a prison cell than anything, with only two torches to keep the chamber barely lit. At the very back of the room, on a pedestal, was a rod of some sort, wrapped in leather and about as long as his forearm.
>>   
>>   There wasn’t much time to sit and stare though, as there was a commotion outside and he could hear shouting and the jangling of keys. He cursed himself silently. Of course they would have sigils protecting something so secretive. Probably set off the very moment he entered here. He had not considered the minutia of his plan, through the wreck of emotions and dire urgency. He was honestly lucky to have made it this far. He went to run towards the artifact but found himself unable too. Moving closer to the object set his hairs on end. His very soul screamed out that this thing was wrong and moving towards it went against his very being as a mortal. The mental toil meant the best he could do was a fast walk towards it. 
>>   
>>   He got within arm’s reach of it when the door burst open. He afforded himself a look back. It was the Council of Three together with Bellam. Lord Kerith and Lady Tara’s uncoordinated shouting collided into an indecipherable word soup, Lord Piyar said nothing and simply stared at him with that indiscernible face of his. Bellam also said nothing; however he did not need to. His eyes spoke everything he needed. They begged Ennarka not to take another step forward, to turn around and beg the forgiveness of the Council, and not to shame him like this. Ennarka hoped his eyes communicated back that he was truly sorry, and that he hopes he can come to understand why he has done this. And with one swift motion, he grabbed the rod, which felt painfully cold in his hand, and muttered something his pursuers could not hear, and was whisked away by whatever contract he made.
>>   
>>   #### Aftermath 
>>   Ennarka has spent his time since escaping laying low, surviving as a criminal, doing thefts, smuggling, and anything that doesn’t hurt innocent people directly and isn’t high profile. 
>>   
>>   Bellam, on the other hand, has been disgraced. Ennarka was his charge, his responsibility since childhood. And not only has he become a detriment to the order, but, as they see it, an enemy! Bellam’s only chance for redemption now lies in hunting his brother down and recovering both him and the artifact, dead or alive in Ennarka’s case, and completing his Final Duty. Bellam Balehound is now restlessly hunting down his once-beloved brother in hopes to make his sins to the Order right again..

Concept

Ennarka is a Hexblade Warlock who grew up in and is a former member of the Order of the Mindful Eyes. He betrayed the order when his brother became slated to sacrifice himself to keep an artifact contained. Ennarka stole the artifact and made a deal/contract with the power/being contained within and is now on the run as the Order has sent his brother after him to reclaim the relic.

Backstory

Family

Ennarka was born into the Order of the Mindful Eyes, fathered by an Order Hunter, Verak Swiftsword, and mothered by an Order Cook, Sina Woodgate, whom Verak saved while on the trail of an artifact and brought into the fold of the Order for her protection. Ennarka is their second child, their first being a boy named Bellam, who was seven at the time of Ennarka’s birth.

Verak is an ardent member of the Order, and as such insisted on strictly following Order tradition with both children. With much convincing, and great reluctance on her part, Sina agreed. Once Bellam was weaned off her milk and was able to walk with sure footing, he was taken by the Order for general training and teaching. Sina, however, had not grown up within the walls of the Order and did not hold the reverence for its traditions and ways her beloved husband did. And as such only really intended to follow them as much as she could get away with. So, when Bellam was around five and she could trust him to keep a secret, she found him at a time when he was alone from his carers and told him who she was, and what he was to her, and that she very much loved him so, and always would (though she would never reveal who his father was, out of respect for her husband and his wish to adhere to Order tradition). And so it went for the next few years that Bellam would twice a week, sneak out to the cooks’ quarters and rendezvous with his mother, who would tell him stories and legends her parents told her, and cook small meals for the boy.

This would go even into the first trimester of her second pregnancy, and he would be introduced to his younger brother Ennarka. These secret maternal meetings could not continue beyond that as she could no longer reside in the cooks’ quarters beyond her first trimester and had midwives caring for her in the maternal ward. And so, Bellam went headfirst into his mental and martial training, to become an agent of the Order who could protect his mom and new brother.

The Birth and Young Life of Ennarka

As previously stated, Ennarka is the second son of Order Hunter Verak Swiftsword, and Order Cook Sina Woodgate. He was born small and sickly. Oftentimes it was wondered by physician and mother alike whether he would survive his infancy or not. Verak would only visit rarely, and while the midwives would viciously gossip about his apparent apathy, Sina took no offense. She knew that he was simply scared that his son may not live to receive a second name. Ennarka eventually did survive through his eighteenth month, and though he was still weak and smaller than most, the physicians of the order believed he had a greater chance of surviving than dying for now.

Not soon after Ennarka started his upward trend of health, his mother Sina’s went into swift decline. Some say it was the stress of nursing a sickly baby, some say it was the very sickness her newborn bore. Regardless of reason or blame, Sina would not live to see her second son turn three.

After her death and burial, the Order had a decision to make. There was now a young toddler, not yet three, with no caretaker. A toddler who was small and weak, so much so it was doubtful he could endure the trials and tribulations required for induction into the Order. The Order wasn’t even sure he would be of use as a farmer or cook, such was his physical state. A ward who would be nothing but a burden on the Order, who value utility above all. Bellam, age ten, knew what this would mean. He would be cast out into the wilderness, his fate left to the gods and devils of the world. He could not let it happen.

So, young Bellam, at an age where his training was in a far more independent curriculum in order to ascertain which faction he and his peers would be assigned to, snuck away during the day and found his way to the entrance of the Council of Three. Nobody beyond the four of them knows what was discussed there, whether Bellam revealed his knowledge of their familial connection or not. But the outcome was the decree that Young Bellam would have until he would enter an apprenticeship at thirteen to train and raise Ennarka into a child befitting induction into the Order. He would do it with no help from Order Instructors and while keeping up with his own training. The Order would not tolerate any burden to their operation.

For the next three years Bellam barely slept, training in the day and acting as instructor for his brother into the night. While he pushed both himself and his brother to their limits, he was always sure to never be cruel in doing so. He wished for him to be strong to survive, but he also wished to show him the kindness of their mother in her stead. And so over these three years eating, sweating, and learning together, the brothers forged an inseparable bond.

On the day Bellam was to be given a caste and a master to study under, Ennarka, age six, was also slated to be given a special mental and physical test to serve as proof he was capable enough to be of use to the order. He knew he must pass, or else he would never be able to see his older brother again, and would likely mean some sort of punishment for Bellam as well. He was still a fairly weak child, but he was not so frail anymore, and Bellam had honed his mind, taught him to be quite clever and calculating. Any test of strength he managed to outwit, and passed the trials with relative ease. And so as Ennarka was finally welcomed into the Order, his brother was accepted into the Hunter caste and assigned a master.

Adolescence and Apprenticeship

Ennarka fit well with his peers while training as a boy. He wasn’t boisterous, or even incredibly social, but he was quiet and showed kindness to his fellow students. And though he was never among the best in martial training, he was an astute learner and showed a thirst to always know more, which was a pleasure to his instructors.

Always trying to strike deals or enable escape in return for the enquirer's wildest dreams. Gleaning any relevant research or information out of them without giving them anything in return was a nigh impossible task for any but the shrewdest and most discerning of Enquirers. It was Ennarka’s silver tongue and clever mind that allowed him to do just that, and earned him the second name of Voidseeker.

Betraying the Order

Ennarka was twenty and had been living well within the Order, making a name for himself as a skilled Enquirer, even earning the approval of the Councilman of the Enquirers: Piyar Devilchain. /// He got regular visits from his brother after every hunt, and though Bellam and he had to keep this familial bond secret or risk expulsion from the Order, they would not hide that they were the closest of friends. One morning Bellam arrived at his quarters early in the morning, looking more grim than Ennarka had ever seen him.

“There is an artifact within the order, brother, I am not sure exactly what, the Council refuses to say. All I know is that its sentient, and the Council will keep it under wraps by any means necessary... and that, in order to keep it sated and restrained, the Council has been sacrificing one member of the Order to it every ten years.”

At that point Bellam could not look his brother in the eye and Ennarka knew what came next.

“A lottery has been held, as it apparently has every ten years, and I have been chosen, brother, to be the newest sacrifice.”

Ennarka’s mind immediately spun, it felt like the ground would give way beneath him. The Order would do such a thing? To his brother of all people, who served so nobly? But not a second later his mind raced with solutions, and he started thinking out loud. “We could run Bellam, run to where the Order might never find us. Ah! Or better yet, we could go to the Council, perhaps suggest sourcing criminals from a nearby kingdom-,”

Bellam cut him off with a sudden, tight hug. It told Ennarka everything he had been dreading to hear. His brother, noble fool he is, would not run from his duty and would not entertain the Order committing such an evil as to take the lives of outsiders for detaining an artifact.

Cherish it and survive me by bringing the Order one step closer to thwarting the Evils beyond our world through your skills as an Enquirer. I must prepare now, brother. My final duty is to be done at midnight. I love you, Ennarka,”

And with those final words to his brother, and a tight squeeze, he disappeared before Ennarka could react, leaving him reeling with the void of the news and his own sinking gut. He could not stand for this. Would not. Bellam was his brother, the very reason he was alive today. And in the silence and whirlwind of emotions, he made up his mind. He would return the favor; he would save his brother. He would take the artifact and run, after all, he cannot be sacrificed to it if it is no longer there.

It was likely that that information was only passed down from relevant enquirer to enquirer as they got an apprentice. Though this did not matter. To Ennarka, it could hold the darkest of gods and the very destruction of half the world, and he would still do what he must now.

And so Ennarka stalked the ward it was held in, waited until Curator guards were switching shifts, and used the few second window to sneak himself in. It was an austere stone room, akin more to a prison cell than anything, with only two torches to keep the chamber barely lit. At the very back of the room, on a pedestal, was a rod of some sort, wrapped in leather and about as long as his forearm.

There wasn’t much time to sit and stare though, as there was a commotion outside and he could hear shouting and the jangling of keys. He cursed himself silently. Of course they would have sigils protecting something so secretive. Probably set off the very moment he entered here. He had not considered the minutia of his plan, through

the wreck of emotions and dire urgency. He was honestly lucky to have made it this far. He went to run towards the artifact but found himself unable too. Moving closer to the object set his hairs on end. His very soul screamed out that this thing was wrong and moving towards it went against his very being as a mortal. The mental toil meant the best he could do was a fast walk towards it.

He got within arm’s reach of it when the door burst open. He afforded himself a look back. It was the Council of Three together with Bellam. Lord Kerith and Lady Tara’s uncoordinated shouting collided into an indecipherable word soup, Lord Piyar said nothing and simply stared at him with that indiscernible face of his. Bellam also said nothing; however he did not need to. His eyes spoke everything he needed. They begged Ennarka not to take another step forward, to turn around and beg the forgiveness of the Council, and not to shame him like this. Ennarka hoped his eyes communicated back that he was truly sorry, and that he hopes he can come to understand why he has done this. And with one swift motion, he grabbed the rod, which felt painfully cold in his hand, and muttered something his pursuers could not hear1, and was whisked away by whatever contract he made.

Aftermath

Ennarka has spent his time since escaping laying low, surviving as a criminal, doing thefts, smuggling, and anything that doesn’t hurt innocent people directly and isn’t high profile.

Bellam, on the other hand, has been disgraced. Ennarka was his charge, his responsibility since childhood. And not only has he become a detriment to the order, but, as they see it, an enemy! Bellam’s only chance for redemption now lies in hunting his brother down and recovering both him and the artifact, dead or alive in Ennarka’s case, and completing his Final Duty. Bellam Balehound is now restlessly hunting down his once-beloved brother in hopes to make his sins to the Order right again.

Notes/Annotations

1: I’m not exactly sure what I want Ennarka’s patron to be or the deal they strike. I suppose the deal depends on what the patron is exactly, and I have one or two ideas I’ll list here but I think this would be an easier thing to discuss in person or over a call if you have any questions or suggestions/ideas.

Idea One: The artifact holds whatever the equivalent of a baby would be to void beings/void gods. Very immature, and somewhat naïve, nowhere near as powerful as a fully formed/mature void god/being which is why the Order has been able to keep it restrained and want it back. It is a rare opportunity to study they’re otherworldly enemy in a way they never have before.
