# VOID PARASITES: (Intermediate)

## 1. Zar'than The Decay:

 - Personality: Zar'than is a malevolent and twisted entity, their presence dripping with malice and corruption. They exude an aura of decay and despair, their very existence a blight upon the fabric of reality. Zar'than is consumed by a desire to spread their dark influence throughout the void, their every action driven by a relentless thirst for chaos and destruction.

 - Goal: Zar'than's ultimate objective is to corrupt and consume all that lies before them, twisting the very essence of existence to suit their nefarious whims. They seek to plunge the universe into an eternal abyss of darkness and despair, feeding off the suffering and misery of all who fall beneath their shadow. Zar'than believes that by embracing their twisted nature, they can achieve true supremacy and reshape the cosmos in their image.

 - Interaction with Races and Factions: Zar'than seeks to spread their dark influence throughout the cosmos, targeting factions and races that stand in their way. They harbor a deep-seated resentment towards the Order of the Eternal Light, a group of celestial beings dedicated to maintaining purity and order, and the Circle of Renewal, a sect of healers and mystics who seek to heal the wounds of the world

 - Ideas: Zar'than's ideology revolves around the concept of corruption and decay. They view the user as a vessel through which they can spread their dark influence, a pawn in their quest for ultimate power. Zar'than believes that by corrupting the very fabric of reality, they can sow the seeds of chaos and destruction and reshape the destiny of the universe.

 - Side Effects: Interacting with Zar'than fills the user with an overwhelming sense of despair and hopelessness, seeping into their thoughts and emotions. The user's once optimistic outlook becomes clouded by thoughts of impending doom and decay, influencing their decision-making and interactions with others. They may find themselves more prone to acts of selfishness and cruelty, as Zar'than's whispers drive them to embrace the darkness within. Over time, the user's mind becomes fragmented and distorted, their once vibrant personality fading into obscurity as they become increasingly consumed by Zar'than's malevolent influence. However, this relentless pursuit of darkness comes at a cost, as the user's soul is gradually consumed by the void, leaving behind only a husk of their former self.

   ###### Examples:
 - Role-Playing Side Effect: During interactions with NPCs, the player may find themselves expressing a more cynical and pessimistic worldview, mirroring Zar'than's influence. They may become more inclined to make morally ambiguous decisions, prioritizing their own interests over those of others. This can lead to conflicts within the party and strained relationships with NPCs.

  - Interaction Effect: When engaging in combat, the player's character may exhibit signs of inner turmoil and hesitation, reflecting the creeping despair brought on by Zar'than's influence. This could manifest as a penalty to initiative rolls or a temporary reduction in combat effectiveness as the character grapples with their inner demons.

					(these are examples if you want to change these please message me)

 - Unique Benefit: Zar'than bestows upon the user the power of Void Corruption, a spell that inflicts lingering damage and debuffs on their enemies. When cast, Void Corruption corrupts the very essence of the target, causing them to suffer damage over time and reducing their effectiveness in combat. Additionally, it spreads to nearby enemies and allies, creating a chain reaction of decay and despair.

## 2. Vor'thul the Void Harbinger:

 - Personality: Vor'thul is a harbinger of doom and despair, their presence heralding the coming of darkness and destruction. They exude an aura of malevolent energy, their very existence a harbinger of the void's inexorable advance. Vor'thul is consumed by a desire to bring about the end of days, their every action driven by a relentless thirst for annihilation and oblivion.

 - Goal: Vor'thul's ultimate objective is to unleash the full fury of the void upon the cosmos, bringing about the total annihilation of all existence. They seek to shroud the universe in eternal darkness, ushering in a new era of chaos and despair. Vor'thul believes that by embracing their role as the harbinger of doom, they can achieve true supremacy and reshape the very fabric of reality.

 - Interaction with Races and Factions: Vor'thul seeks to bring about the end of days, targeting factions and races that cling to the fleeting promise of existence. They harbor a deep-seated resentment towards the Guardians of the Light, a group of celestial beings dedicated to preserving the balance of the cosmos, and the Order of the Everlasting Dawn, a sect of mystics and prophets who foretell of a future free from darkness.

 - Ideas: Vor'thul's ideology revolves around the concept of destruction and oblivion. They view the user as an instrument of their divine wrath, a tool to be wielded in their quest for universal annihilation. Vor'thul believes that by unleashing the full fury of the void, they can cleanse the cosmos of all life and usher in a new era of darkness and despair.

- Side Effects: Interacting with Vor'thul fills the user with an overwhelming sense of dread and despair, permeating their thoughts and emotions with a foreboding sense of doom. The user's once rational mind becomes clouded by paranoia and irrational fear, causing them to question the motives of those around them and act impulsively in moments of crisis. Vor'thul's relentless whispers drive the user to embrace their darkest impulses, leading them down a path of self-destruction and madness. As the influence of Vor'thul grows stronger, the user's grip on reality begins to slip, their sanity crumbling like sand through their fingers. However, this relentless pursuit of destruction comes at a cost, as the user's mind is gradually consumed by madness, leaving behind only a husk of their former self.

  ###### Examples:
 - Role-Playing Side Effect: The player may begin to display signs of paranoia and mistrust towards their allies, fueled by Vor'thul's whispers of impending doom. They may become more secretive and withdrawn, reluctant to share information or cooperate with others out of fear of betrayal. This can lead to tension within the party and hinder group cohesion.

  - Interaction Effect: During combat encounters, the player's character may exhibit erratic behavior and unpredictable decision-making, reflecting their descent into madness under Vor'thul's influence. This could manifest as random targeting of allies or reckless disregard for their own safety, putting the party at risk of harm.  
  
					(these are examples if you want to change these please message me)

 - Unique Benefit: Vor'thul bestows upon the user the power of Void Eruption, a devastating spell that unleashes a wave of destructive energy upon their enemies. When cast, Void Eruption creates a burst of void energy that deals massive damage to all nearby foes and leaves them vulnerable to further attacks. Additionally, it inflicts a debuff that reduces the effectiveness of healing and regeneration, leaving enemies weakened and vulnerable to Vor'thul's relentless assault.

# VOID MARKINGS: (Lesser)

## 1. Zyxel the Forgotten Shadow:

- **Personality**: Zyxel is a cunning and manipulative entity, adept at exploiting the vulnerabilities of the user as a mere vessel for chaos and darkness. He possesses a charismatic charm that conceals their true intentions, luring the user into a web of deceit and manipulation. Despite their whimsical facade, Zyxel's true nature is one of insidious cunning and calculated malice.

- **Goal**: Zyxel's ultimate objective is to sow discord and unrest throughout the user's world, thriving on the negative energy generated by conflict and despair. They strategically manipulate events and individuals to further their agenda, orchestrating chaos from the shadows. Zyxel seeks not only to spread chaos but also to revel in the suffering it brings, feeding off the anguish and despair of those caught in its wake.

- **Interaction with Races and Factions**: Zyxel meticulously targets vulnerable factions, exploiting their weaknesses and driving them to self-destruct. They harbor a deep-seated animosity towards the Radiant Accord, a group dedicated to maintaining harmony through the power of light. Additionally, Zyxel despises the Abyssal Syndicate, a rival faction that seeks to spread chaos and darkness in their own twisted way. Zyxel works tirelessly to undermine these factions, sowing seeds of discord and distrust among their ranks while manipulating events from the shadows to further their own agenda.

- **Side Effects**: Interacting with Zyxel infuses the user with a deep-seated affinity for deception and manipulation, warping their perception of reality. Trust becomes a foreign concept, replaced by a pervasive sense of suspicion and the belief that every truth conceals a lie. The user's thoughts increasingly dwell in shadows, finding comfort in secrecy and the subtle art of influence. Over time, this influence distorts the user's personality, amplifying traits of cunning and duplicity while eroding their capacity for openness and honesty.

  ###### Example:
 - **Role-Playing Side Effect**: In role-playing scenarios, the user might find themselves defaulting to manipulation, even in situations where it might not be necessary. Their interactions become a game of control, where every conversation is an opportunity to influence and every relationship is measured by the leverage it provides. This transformation can alienate allies and complicate their interactions with others, as they begin to see manipulation where there is none and plot where there is only plain truth. 

  - **Interaction Effect**: In group dynamics, the user may start to operate independently, favoring personal schemes over shared objectives. Their actions might become unpredictable, guided by a logic understood only to them, driven by the whispers of Zyxel. Allies might observe a chilling detachment in the user's decisions, a willingness to use others as pawns in their elaborate strategies, often without regard for the consequences. The user's increasing reliance on deception can sow distrust, creating rifts within the group and potentially undermining collective goals for personal gain.  
  
					(these are examples if you want to change these please message me)

   - **Ideas**: Zyxel champions the art of influence and control, teaching that true power lies in the unseen and the unspoken. They believe in the supremacy of the mind over brute strength, advocating for a world where secrets hold the key to dominion. Zyxel sees the cosmos as an intricate web of connections and relationships, all ripe for exploitation. They instill in the user a deep understanding of psychological manipulation, enabling them to discern desires, fears, and motivations in others. This knowledge allows the user to craft elaborate schemes, turning potential threats into unwitting allies and orchestrating events from the shadows to achieve their ends. Zyxel's doctrine is one of patience and subtlety, where the most effective form of control is the one that remains hidden, shaping the world through whispers and nudges rather than overt displays of power.

   - **Unique Benefit**: Shadow Manipulation, granted by Zyxel, is not merely a spell but a profound mastery over the essence of shadow and deception. Users can weave shadows into complex illusions, creating scenarios so real that they can deceive even the most discerning eyes. This ability extends beyond mere visual trickery; it can manipulate emotions, plant ideas, or erase memories, altering perceptions to suit the user's will. In combat, these shadows can become tangible, ensnaring foes, disarming them, or even turning their own shadows against them. Strategically, this power is invaluable for espionage, infiltration, or escape, offering a plethora of creative and versatile applications that embody Zyxel's ethos of control through obscurity.

On a roll of 5 or lower, the Shadow Echo distorts your spell, targeting a random ally within range with the spell's effect instead.<br><br>   - New Rule (Shadow Echo): Keep track of the Shadow Echo with a marker or token. The echo represents Zyxel's influence over your actions, twisting your intentions. The Echo can be dispelled by a *dispel magic* spell or similar effects.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Level 7: Shadow Masquerade**    | - Action: As an action, envelop an ally or yourself in shadows, altering appearances and auras to mimic another being or to become unseen.<br><br>- Effect: The transformation lasts for 10 minutes, granting advantage on Deception and Stealth checks. If used in combat, the first attack against the transformed individual has disadvantage.<br><br>- Team Synergy: Allies can use the transformed figure as a decoy, repositioning without attracting attention.<br><br>- Usage: Once per long rest.<br><br>- Side Effect (Shadow Debt): After the illusion ends, you incur a Shadow Debt, weakening your connection to the material plane. For the next hour, you take double damage from non-magical attacks.<br><br>- New Rule (Shadow Debt): Mark the Shadow Debt with a token. The Debt symbolizes the price of tampering with one's essence through shadows. It can be removed by completing a short rest, representing the re-anchoring of your essence to the material plane.                                                                                                                      |
| **Level 11: Mind's Labyrinth**    | - Action: As an action, trap an enemy's mind in an illusory labyrinth, causing confusion and fear.<br><br>- Effect: The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute as it navigates the maze. The target can make another save at the end of each of its turns.<br><br>- Team Synergy: While the target is trapped, allies have advantage on attack rolls against it.<br><br>- Usage: Once per long rest.<br><br>- Side Effect (Labyrinth's Echo): After using Mind's Labyrinth, your perception is altered, seeing the world as a twisting maze. For the next 10 minutes, all terrain is considered difficult terrain for you, reflecting the labyrinth's lingering influence on your mind.<br><br> - New Rule (Labyrinth's Echo): The Echo affects your movement, symbolizing the disorienting aftereffect of casting such a complex illusion. This effect can be negated by a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each minute, as you regain your normal perception.                                                                                      |
| **Level 15: Echoes of the Void**  | - Action: As an action, create illusory duplicates of yourself or an ally within 60 feet.<br><br>- Effect: These duplicates last for 1 minute and can move independently, mimicking actions realistically. Observers must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern the real from the illusion.<br><br>- Team Synergy: Attacks targeting the duplicates reveal the attacker's position, granting allies advantage on their next attack against the exposed enemy.<br><br>- Usage: Once per long rest.<br><br>- Side Effect (Void Imprint): After the duplicates vanish, a Void Imprint remains on you for 1 hour. During this time, any spell you cast has a 10% chance to fail, as the void energy interferes with your magical connection.<br><br>- New Rule (Void Imprint): When casting a spell, roll a d100. If you roll 10 or under, the spell fails but does not consume a spell slot. This reflects the unpredictable nature of tapping into void energy for illusions.                                                                                                                |
| **Level 19: Dominion of Shadows** | - Action: As an action, unleash a wave of shadow energy that manipulates the very essence of those caught within.<br><br>- Effect: Enemies within a 30-foot radius must make a Charisma saving throw or be charmed for 1 minute, believing they are in your debt or under your control. While charmed in this way, they cannot attack you or your allies.<br><br>- Team Synergy: Charmed enemies can be commanded to reveal secrets, drop their weapons, or impart strategic advantages, offering critical intelligence or battlefield support without direct combat.<br><br>- Usage: Once per long rest.<br><br>- Side Effect (Dominion's Backlash): After using Dominion of Shadows, you experience a backlash, rendering you vulnerable to radiant damage for the next 24 hours, as the light seeks to cleanse the shadow you've wielded.<br><br>- New Rule (Dominion's Backlash): Track this vulnerability with a token. If you take radiant damage while vulnerable, you must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn, overwhelmed by the purging light. |

| **Level 3: Shadow's Whisper**    | - Action: As a bonus action, you can whisper a shadowy curse to a target within 60 feet, sowing seeds of mistrust.<br><br> - Effect: The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to attack its nearest ally on its next turn with a basic attack. This effect subtly influences the target's mind, appearing as a natural decision rather than an imposed one.<br><br> - Team Synergy: If the target acts on the whisper, its attack gains a bonus equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, and your allies gain insight into the target's weaknesses, granting them advantage on their next attack against it.<br><br> - Usage: Once per short rest.<br><br> - Side Effect (Whispering Echoes): After using the ability, your perception becomes filled with whispering echoes for 1 hour, making it challenging to discern other sounds. This effect imposes a disadvantage on checks that rely on hearing.<br><br>- New Mechanic (Whispering Echoes): Whenever you attempt to listen for something specific or need to focus on auditory details, you must roll twice and take the lower result due to the distracting whispers.**                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Level 7: Guise of the Unseen** | - Action: As an action, cast an illusory veil over yourself or an ally, granting invisibility or altering the appearance to match any other creature of similar size.<br>- Effect: The illusion lasts for up to 10 minutes and grants a bonus to Stealth and Deception checks equal to your level. If used for invisibility, the effect ends when the target attacks or casts a spell.<br>- Team Synergy: While under the guise, the target can covertly position themselves for a strategic advantage, granting them a critical strike on their next attack from stealth.<br>- Usage: Once per long rest.<br>- Side Effect (Identity Rift): After the illusion fades, you experience a temporary identity rift, causing confusion about your true form. For the next 30 minutes, any spell or ability you use that requires self-identification (like teleportation or self-targeting spells) has a 20% chance to fail as you momentarily lose sense of your own identity.<br>- New Mechanic (Identity Rift): Roll a d100 after casting a self-targeting spell or ability. On a roll of 1-20, the spell fails as you cannot fully grasp your own identity to direct the spell's effects.<br>                                                                                                                                            |

| **Level 11: Mirage of Madness**  | - Action: As an action, create a pervasive illusion that distorts perception for all enemies within a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose.<br>- Effect: Affected enemies see hallucinations and phantasmal threats, making them unable to distinguish friend from foe and causing them to randomly target nearby creatures for their attacks. The effect lasts for 1 minute, with a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each turn to end it.<br>- Team Synergy: Allies gain advantage on attacks against affected enemies as they navigate the chaotic illusions.<br>- Usage: Once per long rest.<br>- Side Effect (Hallucinatory Snare): The strain of creating the pervasive illusion causes your mind to become susceptible to hallucinations. Randomly, over the next 2 hours, you might see enemies that aren't there, potentially causing you to waste actions or resources on these illusions.<br>- New Mechanic (Hallucinatory Snare): At random intervals determined by the DM, roll a d20. On a roll of 1-5, you perceive a nonexistent enemy and are compelled to address it, potentially wasting your action for that turn.**                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Level 15: Umbra's Embrace**    | - Action: As an action, summon a dense shroud of shadows in a 30-foot radius. The shroud muffles sound and blocks vision, creating a zone of darkness and silence.<br>- Effect: Within the shroud, enemies are blinded and deafened, and magical light cannot illuminate the area. The shroud lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it as a bonus action.<br>- Team Synergy: Allies within the shroud are undetectable by sight or sound and can pass through it without hindrance, allowing for surprise maneuvers and protected communication.<br>- Usage: Once per long rest.<br>- Side Effect (Shadow Imprint): After the shroud ends, a shadow imprint remains on you, causing your shadow to behave independently for 24 hours. This unpredictable shadow can attract unwanted attention or disturb light-based mechanisms and traps.<br>- New Mechanic (Shadow Imprint): Your independent shadow can trigger light-sensitive traps or draw the gaze of creatures. The DM might require Stealth checks at disadvantage or trigger traps as if you were in two places at once.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **Level 19: Shadow Dominion**    | - Action: As an action, bend the very essence of shadows to your will, exerting control over the actions of any creatures standing in darkness or shadow within 100 feet.<br>- Effect: Targets in shadows must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or follow a single command you issue on their next turn, as per the *Command* spell, but without the verbal component limitation. This control is subtle, making targets rationalize the compelled action as their own decision.<br>- Team Synergy: If a controlled enemy performs an action beneficial to your team (like dropping a weapon, revealing information, or moving strategically), your allies gain a surge of confidence, granting them temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.<br>- Usage: Once per long rest.<br>- Side Effect (Dominion's Echo): Post-dominion, you are haunted by an echo of the controlled shadows, making you see allies with a shadowy aura. For the next 3 turns in combat, there's a chance you might perceive an ally as an enemy, complicating your decision-making.<br>- New Mechanic (Dominion's Echo): On your turn, roll a d6. On a roll of 1, you confuse an ally for an enemy, potentially directing an attack or hostile spell towards them unless you choose to forfeit your action to resist the confusion. |

## 3. Grog'nak the Raging Voidfire:

   - Personality: Grog'nak is a savage and primal entity, driven by an insatiable hunger for power and domination. They possess an overwhelming presence that instills fear and terror in those around them, commanding respect through brute force and intimidation. Grog'nak's presence is suffused with an aura of unrestrained violence and aggression, leaving those who encounter it quaking in fear.

   - Goal: Grog'nak's primary objective is to spread chaos and destruction throughout the user's world, feeding off their pain and suffering to fuel their insatiable appetite for destruction. They revel in the chaos they unleash, delighting in the screams of their victims as they succumb to the void. Grog'nak sees itself as a force of nature, an unstoppable juggernaut that leaves nothing but devastation in its wake.

   - Interaction with Races and Factions: Grog'nak strategically targets the Sylvan Conclave, a group dedicated to protecting the balance of nature within the northern lands of Angurma. They also harbor a deep-seated hatred towards the Obsidian Legion, a ruthless faction of conquerors who seek to bend the world to their will through force and tyranny. Grog'nak seeks to crush these factions beneath its heel, leaving nothing but ash and ruin in its wake while asserting its dominance over the shattered remnants of their once-mighty empires.

- Side Effects: Interacting with Grog'nak engulfs the user in the primal essence of destruction and chaos, altering their fundamental drive towards aggression and dominance. The user begins to view strength and power as the ultimate virtues, with compassion and diplomacy becoming alien concepts. Their instincts become more feral, their emotions rawer and closer to the surface, leading to a more primal, less calculated approach to challenges. This shift can cause a deep internal conflict, especially if the user's nature was less inclined toward such raw expression of power and aggression.

  ###### Examples:
 - Role-Playing Side Effect: In role-playing scenarios, the user might find themselves resorting to intimidation and aggression as first responses. Dialogue may become terse, with the user favoring direct and often violent solutions over negotiation or subtlety. Relationships may strain as the user's newfound ferocity and impatience with weakness or subtlety become apparent, potentially leading to conflicts with allies who are disturbed or frightened by the user's transformation.

  - Interaction Effect: Within a group, the user may become more solitary or assume the role of an enforcer, driven by a guttural sense of survival and supremacy. Their strategies may lean towards the overtly aggressive, favoring frontal assaults or displays of power over intricate planning. This behavior can unsettle allies, who might find the user's company increasingly volatile and unpredictable. The user's growing disdain for weakness could lead to tension, especially with those who advocate for diplomacy or caution, potentially fracturing group cohesion and undermining shared objectives in favor of personal glory or battle lust.

  - Ideas: Grog'nak represents the primal, untamed forces of destruction, advocating for a world shaped by strength and survival. They see the universe as an arena of endless conflict, where only the most powerful can claim dominion. Grog'nak instills in the user a primal ferocity and an unquenchable thirst for conquest, teaching that true power is won through dominance and intimidation. This raw, destructive force is not mindless; it is the means to purge weakness and forge a new order from the ashes of the old. Grog'nak's philosophy is one of transformation through destruction, where the old must be razed to make way for the new. Under Grog'nak's tutelage, the user learns to harness their inner fury, channeling it into a force that can shake the very foundations of the world, inspiring awe and fear in equal measure. 

   - Unique Benefit: Voidfire Blast is a manifestation of Grog'nak's essence, a cataclysmic explosion of dark energy that embodies the raw power of destruction. This ability allows the user to unleash torrents of voidfire, incinerating enemies and obliterating obstacles with unrivaled intensity. The flames of voidfire are not ordinary; they burn not just the flesh but the spirit, sapping strength and will from those they touch. In battle, this power is a fearsome weapon, capable of turning the tide against overwhelming odds, leaving devastation in its wake. Beyond its destructive capacity, Voidfire Blast serves as a symbol of the user's might, a tangible expression of their dominion over the forces of chaos and destruction, reflecting Grog'nak's belief in the purifying power of unbridled fury and the relentless pursuit of supremacy.

You have disadvantage on Dexterity checks involving fine manipulation.<br>- **New Mechanic (Void Burn):** Whenever you try to grasp, catch, or hold something, roll a d20. On a roll of 5 or lower, the item slips through your grasp, potentially causing minor accidents or noise.                                                                                                                       |

FACTION INFORMATION

  

General Information

In the northern lands of Dulrayea, where myth still lives, exists a clandestine organization of paladins known as The Order of the Mindful Eyes. Their goal is the capture and study of relics and artifacts imbued with the power of the dark forces of the world, so that they may better learn how to combat said forces. They are an incredibly secretive and distrustful group, relaying any knowledge they learn only to factions they truly trust to use it wisely, and even then, only for a price.

  

Organization

The Order of the Mindful Eyes splits its members into three basic roles: Curators, Hunters, and Enquirers. Members are often born into the order and are trained in the basics of the order (combat, their philosophy, basic arithmetic, etc.) from a young age. At the age of thirteen, they are sorted into one of the three roles based on their proclivities. The order also offers protection and housing to those they find who were harmed or affected by the curio they find. Typically, these people will fill the menial roles of sanitation, cooking, farming, etc., but recruitment into the order, while rare, is possible if the person has enough talent.

At the top of the organization is the Council of Three, who always consist of one member from each caste, and serve dutifully until death, upon which another member is voted from within that caste to rise to the office.

Curators: The stock members of the order who fill their fortifications and backbone of the order. Their job is to both administrate the order and guard it. Members of this group have a monthly rotation between active guard duties and administrative ones, such as the training or teaching of young/new members, tending to the injured, and procurement of inventory. They are the main combative force of the order, for when the need for large-scale combat arises, though this is something the order prefers to avoid at all costs.

Hunters: These members are the ones who acquire objects of study for the order. They are a highly individual caste of warriors and seekers, who are given the most freedom of the three groups to operate as they see fit and have around only half the number of the curators. At age thirteen, young members are deemed to have tenacity and curiosity above their peers. They are then taken as an apprentice to a current hunter and learn their ways. Over their life, hunters build up their own personal network of informants they trust, whether they be people they’ve saved while tracking an object of interest, seedier groups they pay, or informants they blackmail. This network reports any suspicious activity or rumor to their hunter through secretive means devised by that hunter alone. The hunter will investigate the information and capture anything of relevance to the order. This highly individualized way of operation ensures that enemies of the order cannot compromise the order’s entire structure should one hunter fail. However, the curators do keep records on the methods and networks of each hunter in case of abrupt death. Hunters will also act as vanguards for the order, tracking and eliminating smaller-scale threats as the order sees fit.

Enquirers: Those chosen for the caste are the ones who single-mindedly carry out the mission of the order: to study dark curio to better learn how to fight evil. Members are selected for this role if they have a strong force of personality, or are particularly clever, as these are necessary to withstand the influence of some of the items they may study over their lifetimes. Enquirers are usually very solitary, whether by the necessity of the objects they study or the eccentricity of a researcher’s lifestyle. They are still trained for combat and expected to take up arms in case of an emergency but are on average the least martially skilled of the order. The objects of their study and methodology of their testing and restraint of said objects is kept only to the relevant enquirers and a curator or two for recording purposes.

  

Culture

As stated above, the Order of the Mindful Eyes is a very secretive and distrustful organization. They have a large emphasis when raising young members on their duty to order and honor, creating a very close-knit community. The order’s primary focus is striving to gain knowledge of supernatural evils and efficiently destroy them. They are very utilitarian in this pursuit, and the actual saving of innocent lives is more of an afterthought to these goals, and while the personal opinions on this vary from member to member, the faction as a whole will rarely move to protect the lives of civilians from a supernatural event/attack unless they believe they can capture and learn from the cause. They find such acts of nobility to be nothing but short-sighted risks.

Members of the order are allowed to wed for the purposes of child-bearing, to keep the order’s ranks consistent. However, they cannot marry someone of the same caste as them, to prevent emotions from becoming detrimental to their duty, and the children they bear are taken from them as toddlers to be raised by the order, never knowing their parents, to ensure loyalty. The parents may give them a first name, but a last name will be chosen for the child befitting their actions or personality while under their apprenticeship as a teen.

The Order isn’t averse to getting its hands dirty and will deploy underhanded means to acquire what it wants and to keep it. Rumors in the order frequently pass around that they even have human sacrifices to sate certain sentient prisoners, but due to the order’s tight lock on information even to its own people these always stay simple rumors told by bored guards on duty. Only the relevant hunters, curators, and enquirers might know such a thing, as well as The Council of Three, who alone are privy to the host of knowledge recorded by the curators in its entirety.

  

The Council of Three

Kerith Holdstrong, Councilman of the Curators: Kerith is an older male dwarf, with a stoic personality. He received his last name as an apprentice when he stood in the frontline and helped fight back a dragon, who was assaulting the order to try and retrieve an artifact they had stolen from it. He is the longest-standing member on the current council.

  

Tara Shadowspeaker, Councilwoman of the Hunters: Tara is a female elf, and as such is technically the oldest member on the council, while being on it the least, with only three years under her belt. This slight subordinacy to the other two members is a constant source of frustration to her. She is a proud and cunning hunter, while also being incredibly personable. She received her name from her extremely vast network of informants and spies that she had built before her apprenticeship was completed. 

Piyar Devilchain, Councilman of the Enquirers: Piyar is a human male in his early 40s with a quiet demeanor. He has been on the council for ten years and is the most well-read of the three. He is often secluded in the records of the curators while not performing council duties. Due to the nature of the enquirers, it isn’t really known how he received his second name; a fact that seems to bring a slight sense of amusement to his usually dreary face when brought up.

Concept

Ennarka is a Hexblade Warlock who grew up in and is a former member of the Order of the Mindful Eyes. He betrayed the order when his brother became slated to sacrifice himself to keep an artifact contained. Ennarka stole the artifact and made a deal/contract with the power/being contained within and is now on the run as the Order has sent his brother after him to reclaim the relic.

Backstory

Family

Ennarka was born into the Order of the Mindful Eyes, fathered by an Order Hunter, Verak Swiftsword, and mothered by an Order Cook, Sina Woodgate, whom Verak saved while on the trail of an artifact and brought into the fold of the Order for her protection. Ennarka is their second child, their first being a boy named Bellam, who was seven at the time of Ennarka’s birth.

Verak is an ardent member of the Order, and as such insisted on strictly following Order tradition with both children. With much convincing, and great reluctance on her part, Sina agreed. Once Bellam was weaned off her milk and was able to walk with sure footing, he was taken by the Order for general training and teaching. Sina, however, had not grown up within the walls of the Order and did not hold the reverence for its traditions and ways her beloved husband did. And as such only really intended to follow them as much as she could get away with. So, when Bellam was around five and she could trust him to keep a secret, she found him at a time when he was alone from his carers and told him who she was, and what he was to her, and that she very much loved him so, and always would (though she would never reveal who his father was, out of respect for her husband and his wish to adhere to Order tradition). And so it went for the next few years that Bellam would twice a week, sneak out to the cooks’ quarters and rendezvous with his mother, who would tell him stories and legends her parents told her, and cook small meals for the boy.

This would go even into the first trimester of her second pregnancy, and he would be introduced to his younger brother Ennarka. These secret maternal meetings could not continue beyond that as she could no longer reside in the cooks’ quarters beyond her first trimester and had midwives caring for her in the maternal ward. And so, Bellam went headfirst into his mental and martial training, to become an agent of the Order who could protect his mom and new brother.

The Birth and Young Life of Ennarka

As previously stated, Ennarka is the second son of Order Hunter Verak Swiftsword, and Order Cook Sina Woodgate. He was born small and sickly. Oftentimes it was wondered by physician and mother alike whether he would survive his infancy or not. Verak would only visit rarely, and while the midwives would viciously gossip about his apparent apathy, Sina took no offense. She knew that he was simply scared that his son may not live to receive a second name. Ennarka eventually did survive through his eighteenth month, and though he was still weak and smaller than most, the physicians of the order believed he had a greater chance of surviving than dying for now. The maternal ward declared it a great miracle. However, the gods do not often give miracles freely.

Not soon after Ennarka started his upward trend of health, his mother Sina’s went into swift decline. Some say it was the stress of nursing a sickly baby, some say it was the very sickness her newborn bore. Regardless of reason or blame, Sina would not live to see her second son turn three.

After her death and burial, the Order had a decision to make. There was now a young toddler, not yet three, with no caretaker. A toddler who was small and weak, so much so it was doubtful he could endure the trials and tribulations required for induction into the Order. The Order wasn’t even sure he would be of use as a farmer or cook, such was his physical state. A ward who would be nothing but a burden on the Order, who value utility above all. Bellam, age ten, knew what this would mean. He would be cast out into the wilderness, his fate left to the gods and devils of the world. He could not let it happen.

So, young Bellam, at an age where his training was in a far more independent curriculum in order to ascertain which faction he and his peers would be assigned to, snuck away during the day and found his way to the entrance of the Council of Three. Nobody beyond the four of them knows what was discussed there, whether Bellam revealed his knowledge of their familial connection or not. But the outcome was the decree that Young Bellam would have until he would enter an apprenticeship at thirteen to train and raise Ennarka into a child befitting induction into the Order. He would do it with no help from Order Instructors and while keeping up with his own training. The Order would not tolerate any burden to their operation.

For the next three years Bellam barely slept, training in the day and acting as instructor for his brother into the night. While he pushed both himself and his brother to their limits, he was always sure to never be cruel in doing so. He wished for him to be strong to survive, but he also wished to show him the kindness of their mother in her stead. And so over these three years eating, sweating, and learning together, the brothers forged an inseparable bond.

On the day Bellam was to be given a caste and a master to study under, Ennarka, age six, was also slated to be given a special mental and physical test to serve as proof he was capable enough to be of use to the order. He knew he must pass, or else he would never be able to see his older brother again, and would likely mean some sort of punishment for Bellam as well. He was still a fairly weak child, but he was not so frail anymore, and Bellam had honed his mind, taught him to be quite clever and calculating. Any test of strength he managed to outwit, and passed the trials with relative ease. And so as Ennarka was finally welcomed into the Order, his brother was accepted into the Hunter caste and assigned a master. Bellam would be leaving, as all hunters must, and training as an apprentice. They would no longer see each other every night, laughing and suffering through training together, as brothers. But the bond they had created would only strengthen over time, and Bellam would never fail to spend the lion’s share of his time back within the Order’s walls with his beloved brother.

Adolescence and Apprenticeship

Ennarka fit well with his peers while training as a boy. He wasn’t boisterous, or even incredibly social, but he was quiet and showed kindness to his fellow students. And though he was never among the best in martial training, he was an astute learner and showed a thirst to always know more, which was a pleasure to his instructors. Meanwhile Bellam had been making a name for himself as an excellent hunter’s apprentice, receiving the second name Balehound for his often-relentless attitude, especially when hunting down those the Order considered dangerous or enemies.

At thirteen, Ennarka was chosen to join the Enquirers for his force of will, soft-spoken, yet clever demeanor, and overall curiosity for learning. His master found that he was quite adept at dealing with the sentient artifacts in their care. Sentient objects were always trying to seduce Enquirers with power, wealth, comfort. Always trying to strike deals or enable escape in return for the enquirer's wildest dreams. Gleaning any relevant research or information out of them without giving them anything in return was a nigh impossible task for any but the shrewdest and most discerning of Enquirers. It was Ennarka’s silver tongue and clever mind that allowed him to do just that, and earned him the second name of Voidseeker.

Betraying the Order

Ennarka was twenty and had been living well within the Order, making a name for himself as a skilled Enquirer, even earning the approval of the Councilman of the Enquirers: Piyar Devilchain. /// He got regular visits from his brother after every hunt, and though Bellam and he had to keep this familial bond secret or risk expulsion from the Order, they would not hide that they were the closest of friends. One morning Bellam arrived at his quarters early in the morning, looking more grim than Ennarka had ever seen him. It worried Ennarka, his brother had always been so strong and upbeat, even in those grueling days of training as children. To look so sullen so openly, something must have been horribly wrong. He invited him in, and that which weighed on Bellam’s mind came spilling forth.

“There is an artifact within the order, brother, I am not sure exactly what, the Council refuses to say. All I know is that its sentient, and the Council will keep it under wraps by any means necessary... and that, in order to keep it sated and restrained, the Council has been sacrificing one member of the Order to it every ten years.”

At that point Bellam could not look his brother in the eye and Ennarka knew what came next.

“A lottery has been held, as it apparently has every ten years, and I have been chosen, brother, to be the newest sacrifice.”

Ennarka’s mind immediately spun, it felt like the ground would give way beneath him. The Order would do such a thing? To his brother of all people, who served so nobly? But not a second later his mind raced with solutions, and he started thinking out loud. “We could run Bellam, run to where the Order might never find us. Ah! Or better yet, we could go to the Council, perhaps suggest sourcing criminals from a nearby kingdom-,”

Bellam cut him off with a sudden, tight hug. It told Ennarka everything he had been dreading to hear. His brother, noble fool he is, would not run from his duty and would not entertain the Order committing such an evil as to take the lives of outsiders for detaining an artifact.

“I am not afraid to give my life for the Order and the greater good we strive for. In fact, I am more than proud to do so. I did not come here to scheme, brother, but to allow us both the small luxury of saying goodbye to our only family. It is one the rest of the Order does not get. Cherish it and survive me by bringing the Order one step closer to thwarting the Evils beyond our world through your skills as an Enquirer. I must prepare now, brother. My final duty is to be done at midnight. I love you, Ennarka,”

And with those final words to his brother, and a tight squeeze, he disappeared before Ennarka could react, leaving him reeling with the void of the news and his own sinking gut. He could not stand for this. Would not. Bellam was his brother, the very reason he was alive today. And in the silence and whirlwind of emotions, he made up his mind. He would return the favor; he would save his brother. He would take the artifact and run, after all, he cannot be sacrificed to it if it is no longer there. It's risky and likely suicidal, and even if he succeeds, the Order will likely hunt him for what might remain of his life. But all of that was better than the thought of his brother dying.

So Ennarka got to work, sneaking into the Archive of the Curators to find what exactly this artifact was and where it was being held. Searching was not nearly as hard as he had thought it might be, he had read almost half of the records already in his spare time. After five hours of scouring, he found what he had been looking for, records on an artifact with sentience that required human sacrifice. Though it was incomplete, it did not state what exactly this artifact was or why it needed to be sacrificed in order to keep it contained. It was likely that that information was only passed down from relevant enquirer to enquirer as they got an apprentice. Though this did not matter. To Ennarka, it could hold the darkest of gods and the very destruction of half the world, and he would still do what he must now.

And so Ennarka stalked the ward it was held in, waited until Curator guards were switching shifts, and used the few second window to sneak himself in. It was an austere stone room, akin more to a prison cell than anything, with only two torches to keep the chamber barely lit. At the very back of the room, on a pedestal, was a rod of some sort, wrapped in leather and about as long as his forearm.

There wasn’t much time to sit and stare though, as there was a commotion outside and he could hear shouting and the jangling of keys. He cursed himself silently. Of course they would have sigils protecting something so secretive. Probably set off the very moment he entered here. He had not considered the minutia of his plan, through

the wreck of emotions and dire urgency. He was honestly lucky to have made it this far. He went to run towards the artifact but found himself unable too. Moving closer to the object set his hairs on end. His very soul screamed out that this thing was wrong and moving towards it went against his very being as a mortal. The mental toil meant the best he could do was a fast walk towards it.

He got within arm’s reach of it when the door burst open. He afforded himself a look back. It was the Council of Three together with Bellam. Lord Kerith and Lady Tara’s uncoordinated shouting collided into an indecipherable word soup, Lord Piyar said nothing and simply stared at him with that indiscernible face of his. Bellam also said nothing; however he did not need to. His eyes spoke everything he needed. They begged Ennarka not to take another step forward, to turn around and beg the forgiveness of the Council, and not to shame him like this. Ennarka hoped his eyes communicated back that he was truly sorry, and that he hopes he can come to understand why he has done this. And with one swift motion, he grabbed the rod, which felt painfully cold in his hand, and muttered something his pursuers could not hear1, and was whisked away by whatever contract he made.

Aftermath

Ennarka has spent his time since escaping laying low, surviving as a criminal, doing thefts, smuggling, and anything that doesn’t hurt innocent people directly and isn’t high profile.

Bellam, on the other hand, has been disgraced. Ennarka was his charge, his responsibility since childhood. And not only has he become a detriment to the order, but, as they see it, an enemy! Bellam’s only chance for redemption now lies in hunting his brother down and recovering both him and the artifact, dead or alive in Ennarka’s case, and completing his Final Duty. Bellam Balehound is now restlessly hunting down his once-beloved brother in hopes to make his sins to the Order right again.

Notes/Annotations

1: I’m not exactly sure what I want Ennarka’s patron to be or the deal they strike. I suppose the deal depends on what the patron is exactly, and I have one or two ideas I’ll list here but I think this would be an easier thing to discuss in person or over a call if you have any questions or suggestions/ideas.

Idea One: The artifact holds whatever the equivalent of a baby would be to void beings/void gods. Very immature, and somewhat naïve, nowhere near as powerful as a fully formed/mature void god/being which is why the Order has been able to keep it restrained and want it back. It is a rare opportunity to study they’re otherworldly enemy in a way they never have before.
