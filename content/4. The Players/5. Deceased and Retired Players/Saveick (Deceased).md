## Backstory

>I’m gonna do it, I have to, I have to leave camp. It’s the most forbidden thing you could ever do. The thing in training they teach you never to try. It could reveal our entire society, who we were, where we lived… But I couldn’t take it anymore. I lived in the village my whole life, I trained with them, I prayed with them, I WAS one of them. Yet they treated me like garbage. I even got my pendant like everyone else. But yet I was still a half-orc, in a clan of orcs who hate outsiders. Still just a mistake that somehow landed on their doorstep. I was just a baby, but some of them even considered throwing me out, leaving this random half-orc child out in the cold to die. Luckily one of the elders named [[Tablin]] took me in, the only person who even treated me like a person. I knew he was frowning upon me from the Stars above, but I must do this. I made sure to grab a map and some food with me, an entire journey on foot alone won’t be easy. But even After everything i’ve experienced, I still considered turning back to my hut, returning to the camp where I would never be accepted, always ridiculed, and mistreated. But I knew what I had to do. I must prove myself to my elders, my family, my entire herd. I didn’t know how I could ever do that, or if I would even be allowed back in after this, but I had to try. And I  have a good idea of where to start.  
>
>I’ve heard scattered talk of the captains discussing bounties, the ones they had on them and the ones they’ve turned in. If I could bring home some money to the clan and the head of a huge beast they might finally accept me, it’s a long shot but it’s the only idea I have. But I have to focus on the here and now. It’s the dead of midnight, I’m standing alone at the steps of the cathedral with a map and a pack of food. I was found here, delivered by someone I’ll probably never get to meet. But that’s in the past. I get on my knees and clutch my pendant, “Allfather, Tablin Murdock, please forgive for what I’m about to do. I can’t take being an outcast anymore. I leave to search for a bounty tonight, something that will hopefully secure my place as a member of the herd. Wish me luck.” I feel my pendant grow warm. It encases me in a blanket of confidence and hope. I nod at the stars and get up from my kneel. I know the entrance to the village is closed shut by a locked gate normally surrounded by guards. But that’s on the other side of town, so I’m safe for now. Then I feel the pendant grow warm again. I had to find my own way out.  
>
>I begin trying to scale the walls, turns out an 8 foot tall hard thatch and wood wall is not easy to climb with a war-hammer. Don’t know why I even bothered. Too thick to pierce as well. Magic was the only way. I shot a guiding bolt straight through the wall. The traveling light illuminated the forest and scared off deer. It left a hole the size of a fist. Perfect. I chucked my rope over the wall and heard the soft thump of it landing. I looked through the hole and saw the rope dangling. I thrust my fist through and grabbed as much rope as I could and tied it to a nearby lantern pole. “This won’t work.” I then tried to scale the wall.  
>
>It didn’t work. At least not as intended. I got up a few feet until the post suddenly got pulled out of the ground and the rope started to slack. My feet started shifting, losing balance.  It was a last resort but I tossed my bag of food over the wall, then using what balance I had left to leap as far as I could. I made it high enough to Grab the edge of the barrier and mantle over, guess I forgot I was on an 8 foot tall wall. I stumbled across and before I could realize I started plummeting to the ground. I shifted my weight to my shoulder and felt a flat leather backpack on my side. It broke most my fall, (still hurt like hell though), but the bag caved in on itself. The food inside crushed. But hey, I did it. Didn’t feel great though. I tried to stand but my legs shook and I collapsed. I gripped my pendant and casted a simple cure wounds on my legs and I was up and standing again. I searched my map… “Hmm, Ennuilands.” I recognized the name instantly. Elders and captains said it constantly with hushed voices when discussing where to hunt and scavenge for food. I’ve always had a keen ear. That didn’t bring hope though. I assumed the crimson palisade could offer bounties, it was the closest civilization, but still multiple days if not weeks away. But I knew how to scavenge. I knew how to hunt.  
>
>I’ve been traveling for three days now, and I’ve just finally left the Ennuilands but another forest lies ahead. Couldn’t go around, didn’t want to go into the wrathfields, or the “woods in which we die” whatever that means. Good on food for now.  
>
> **One week now. Halfway through the forest.**  
Ran out of food, hunted some deer and boar and found a pool of fresh water. Everything hurts. My legs feel like jelly and my head always feels like it’s cut it half. The warmth of the pendant keeps me going. 
>
> **9 days**. Reaching the end of the forest, foods running low again and everything hurts more than before. Guess I was feeling emotional tonight. I set up camp like usual, but then suddenly everything just came crashing down. I collapsed in a waterfall of tears as painful memories flooded back. Tablin, the only good person in my life got taken away, why him? Why him? I had done everything right, I prayed I trained, I was like everyone else. But yet I still am the only one who has to receive the most fowl hate. Only one person understood, and they got taken away. But.. then I… then I felt that blanket again. It evaporated all my tears and I sat up. The freezing winds of the forest felt like a cool breeze. The pain stopped. I rethought everything. Tablin prepared me for this, he knew this would happen. He was the one who gave me the pendant after all. He knew the Allfather would smile upon me, and I realize now, I finally realize, that Tablin isn’t frowning at me from the stars, he’s smiling.  
>
>**11 days now**. Finally out of the forest and I see a huge river with branching tributaries that always seem to connect. I consult my map and continue on, following the river with bright sun setting behind me. Think the warmth from rejuvenated in a way I’ve never felt before.  
>
>**14 days in**. I’m getting close now, I can see people going in and out and I can start to hear the hustle and bustle.  
>
>**18 days**, and I finally made it! My god I can barely stand, I crumple and cry tears of joy, I finally made it! But alas the weird looks from the citizens take me out of it and i continue on. I ask some storefronts where I could start bounty hunting and they all lead me to one place, the bounty hunters guild. But this city is like nothing I’ve ever seen. I’ve heard of the outside from Tablin but I never thought It would look like this. But I couldn’t rest now. I had arrived at my destination and the looming bounty board waits for me. But… Uh… that Dragonborn and half-elf look friendly, maybe they need some help? The pendant grows warm as I walk towards the people that unbeknownst to me, will save my life, and I will save theirs.
