## Backstory
>I was born in iron vale. My father disappeared and mother died when I was young. I was only one when my parents left me so the band of exiles took me in and fed me. In return I learned to entertain and play music. At a young age I was taught many things because of the diverse group of people in the mercenary group. This sparked my interest in history and learning. I would steal books from passing by traders so I could teach myself new things. One day I met a dragon born named Foombaloid. At first sight I knew we had a connection. We both immediately hit it off. My knowledge of history allowed me teach him about his past. He taught me more rugged things like how to fight and survive. We grew up together and he became a paladin. No matter what happened we always stood by each other. As I got older I started to wonder who my was father was and where he went. When I tried to ask I was either ignored or told to stop asking questions. I became tired of not knowing. Me and Foombaloid left to find more about who my father was and more about Foombaloid’s history. After we I wanted to pursue my expanse of knowledge. So I joined the college of lore. There I learned about magic things like magic and history. We heard of this big city called the crismon palisade. We thought there has to be someone who has a lead of knows something about my father there. So we headed there for answers. We joined the mercenaries guild to meet people that could help us find answers and to make some extra cash.
> A couple days ago me, Foombaloid, and a few others got assigned to rob a Caravan that is passing through Ironvale. Should’ve been pretty cut and dry. Ambush the Caravan, get the gold, and get out. It should’ve been but we were not prepared for what was coming. 3 others got assigned to this job. An elf named Prymor, a halfling named Ulrick, and a gnome named Mark. They were all childhood friends. All abandoned like me and joined the band of exiles when they were young. When we all met up outside of town something felt wrong but I thought it was just nerves. I kept seeing this shadowy figure out of the corner of my eye but every time I looked there was nothing there. It felt like I was being watched. After a couple of minutes we saw the caravan but when it got to us there weren’t any people on riding it. Just life sized dolls. The others started looking around the wagons but I saw that same shadowy figure behind a tree so I asked Foombaloid to come check it out with me. Once we get to the tree line the wagons exploded. I saw Ulrick get turned into a red mist. Prymor and Mark were knocked unconscious from the blast. Me and Foombaloid hid among the brushes and brambles of the forest. After a minute passed we saw a group of humans approach the wagons. “Worked like a charm” one of them said. “Bunch of idiots” another one of them said. “Should there be 5 of them?” Said one. “Probably got destroyed in the blast” another replied. “Eh you’re right. What do we do these ones?” He says as he kicks Prymor. “Boss said he wanted them all dead so kill ‘em”. After that the humans execute Prymor and Mark. After that they left.=
>Me and Foombaloid investigated the bodies and the wagons. The wagons were rigged to explode after a certain amount of time and there was no saving Prymor or Mark. I gave them a proper burial remembering all the good times we had together. I finished the burial and began to walk back to Ironvale. As we walked I took one look back at wreckage. Among the destruction I saw the same shadowy figure leaning against the destroyed carriages. It was the same figure I’ve been seeing all day. But this time it didn’t disappear. It felt like it was looking at me. The figure nodded their head almost as if they were tipping their hat to me. I turned around but when I blinked they were gone. We returned to Ironvale and slept. When I talked to Foombaloid in the morning he said he thought he recognized some of the humans as members of the band of exiles. I don’t know what happened that night but something’s happening. Something bad
