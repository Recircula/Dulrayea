## Backstory:
%%
The year was 575, [[Annabelle Cromwell]] (human) of the [[Six Swords]], a group of traveling merchants and bards that buys and sells across the lands, spreading goods and merriment to every tavern of every town they end up in. They were a group of tight-knit adventurers that wished and loved to see the world and loved to spread positivity amidst a terribly, otherwise melancholic world. Annabelle was not inherently proficient in combat but had the voice of an angel and brought tears to the eyes of many weary travelers. Her best friend and lover, [[Castion Ember]](human), being the leader and founder of the group was her everything, her inspiration, her muse. Every time he would enter a room he would light it ablaze with color and personality. He was a master of speechcraft and could sell a painting to a blind man. Next to him, there were the two second-in commands and distributors. They were twin elves named [[Zapta Zalthayrea]] (guy) and [[Zagra Zalthayrea]](Girl) born together, always together, finishing each other's sentences at every opportunity.

Annabelle was often at odds with the erratic twins, disagreeing with the ways they wanted to take the party, usually aiming for more profitable areas and situations but increasing the risk. Annabelle wishes for everything to stay the way that it’s intended, to stay safe. [[Gianna God-Born]] the half-orc warrior was the muscle of the group, if a need for muscle would arise, she would be there at any time or place. Despite her looks and overall demeanor she was always tactful and cunning and could read out a room and assess threats. Last but not least there’s [[Petra Vi]], a tabaxi doctor, and the kindest soul Annabelle has ever met, and retroactively the group mother, was responsible for keeping everyone healthy and happy. She knew the terrain of every place they visited like the back of her hand and could plan accordingly for weather or any potential trouble locations. 

They were all different but all worked as one for many lucrative years. An unfortunate night in the faraway town of [[Glasskeep]] left Annabelle cold and alone in her bed. Castion missing by her side, and everyone but Gianna missing in the inn. Awoken by Gianna she sets out to a neighboring forest to find zapta beaten an inch from his life and cries out to them to help the rest further in the forest. Upon reaching further in a true horror beyond comprehension emerges. Castion stood tall next to a group of hideous beasts, a smile adorning his face, and a sword to a kneeling Petra’s neck. Castion’s sudden wish for insurmountable greed caused him to sell the only friends and the lights in his life to evil, hungry lycan slavers. 

Zagra followed close behind him. Gianna tried to put up a fight but was easily thwarted by the creatures. Castion and Zagra took their share of the riches and spat on the name of the remaining members. Annabelle was defeated, appalled that the man she loved with all of her heart would betray her trust like this. That the man who once shed so much light on her and everyone around her would soon shroud her in complete darkness. The Lycans took Annabelle away to a village named [[Woodspine]]. For 5 arduous years, she was beaten inches from death, tortured, sent to work, and fed slowly day after day, until they could barely feel the pain anymore.

The Lycans noticed Annabelle’s talent and propped her up in their tavern to be the means of entertainment for the hungry and drunk lycans. On many painful nights, she was forced into that role, but she became quite good at listening and gathering information. She had learned that all of her friends were sent to opposite sides of the realm. Castion and Zagra formed an alliance together, leaving as much chaos in their wake as they could. Gianna and Zapta in a faraway camp forced to be sellswords for a cause they did not support. And poor Petra was exiled to live alone with guilt and sadness over that fateful night. Wishing she could change what happened and agonizing over it. They were alive, and for that Annabelle was grateful. 

One night after her set while thrown back in her jail cell, a guard brings a small lycan child and throws them in the cell beside her. It had been caught stealing and had been beaten and bloodied, a fresh scar across its eye. The child growled at Annabelle and backed away with reckless abandon. For many days they sat complacent in their cell. Annabelle’s soft personality beckoned her to reach out to the child after a few attempts at sizing them up. Annabelle finally asked what their name was, and after what seemed like an eternity, they answered Arabella. Days after that they inched closer to her, and Annabelle told the child of all her secrets and dreams. Her adventures with her friends and all the faraway lands she had been to with them, how many smiling faces and eyes they made cry with their performances and how many lives they bettered with the selling of their goods. how close they all truly were, and how hard it hit her when that bond of trust shattered.  

She felt like for the first time in years she had a true connection again. Like the child was truly her own. She wanted more than anything to get out of this hellscape. One night they both awake to the sound of screaming and the clash of swords. The guard gets up and goes to the door. A large magical explosion shatters the door and slams the guard through the door of the hall cell. Annabelle looks in shock and immediately looks to check on the child. They get up and scurry out of the cell hiding behind burnt debris while arrows whiz past their head and into the necks of the adjacent lycans. Whoever was here, was here to burn this place to the ground. Good riddance, Annabelle thought, for they were finally getting the justice that they deserved.  They both moved forward moving past droves of dead bodies and mercenaries-like people fighting the creatures. 

Eventually while staying out of sight they reached the village border. When an arrow came whizzing by and struck Annabelle in the leg. She fell to the ground and the child screamed. A fit of laughter came from a dark corner and a man with black hair and evil eyes wearing polished silver armor bearing an insignia emerged with an elf woman the same insignia marked on her right hand where her bow rests. Annabelle screamed aloud. “CASTION, ZAGRA, NO!” She pleaded for the life of the child. She told them not to be scared, to stay calm, and think of each other, for there was nothing more calming than the thought of a truly loving family. The child rushed to Annabelle but the elf shot an arrow by their feet and told them to stay put. Castion prattled on about money and how after the pay day they gave him he most certainly was gonna come back and finish the job one day. And that this is only the beginning of their reign of terror. 

The child had never seen anyone this heinous before. Filled with so much darkness in his eyes that I terrified the child. Another magical explosion took place, almost startled, Zagra and Castion looked back in curiosity. Annabelle shouted to the child “RUN! RUN AWAY NOW! BE SAFE! FIND THE REST! I LOVE YOU!” A gunshot rang. The child cried for her and ran as fast as their legs could take them. Arrows and bullets flew by one after another, it felt infinite. From the child’s rage and sadness she could almost hear the man yell “YES CHILD! RUN!”, but it was all a blur. They ran and ran for what felt like days.

A few years down the line in Arabella’s journey she followed the twisting and winding paths of the forests towns and grottoes in search for any information on the whereabouts of castion or her long lost friends. To no avail. She had searched day in and day out trying to find answers and would get one step closer only to have it ripped away by something in her path, be it a monster, a bandit, or most of all her own limitations. She had spent years looking over her shoulder barely getting a wink of rest a night, eating nothing but small nuts and berries, sometimes she would get lucky and prey on the wildlife there, cooking them on campfires and looking at the stars, wishing things could’ve been different, wishing annabelle was here by her side again. But she knew that would not happen, all she knew was one day she will avenge her mother and finally get the closure they both deserved. She kept on, hoping and praying that a lead would come her way. Deep down inside there was a small part of her that was afraid as well. Afraid that she would open her eyes to the barrel of a gun, and the same evil smile she saw that day. One day was particularly hard, she had ended up in [redacted], and a giant thunderstorm brewed, seeking shelter where there was none to be found, tired, broken down and hungry from her travels, Arabella’s energy reached its breaking point. She had begun to see flashes of her mother and her cell, bringing back more memories to a time where despite her bad situation, there was a beautiful shining beacon of hope. Unfortunately however the beacon soured and Arabella heard a loud evil laugh, so loud she covered her ears, almost in terror. She fell on the ground hands still to her ears and saw him, his figure, and before passing out, watched as it inched closer. 
 
She woke up immediately to a wooden ceiling. She looked next to her and saw a very large man at her bedside. He was about 6 feet tall with a very stocky build, long flowing black hair, eyes as blue as the ocean, and wore a very elegant black and gold robe. He introduced himself as [[Mikolus]]. He brought her a glass of water, and told her that he was, like the majority of the tight knit community here, a Druid. Arabella, instead of wondering what that meant, decided to wonder how the hell she even got here in the first place. One second she’s down and about in a forest seemingly meeting her end, and the next she’s in a strange bed with someone talking her ear off. She demanded he explain himself, explain why she was here and where she ended up. Mikolus laughed a hardy laugh and told Arabella to take a breath, rest and listen, as if she wanted to hear any of what he had to say, a strange large man showing up and bringing her somewhere and dumping his life story on her? She had half a mind to get up and leave. But everything had caught up with her, and she could barely move, so she listened instead. He told her of the place of which they reside. [[The Forborn Grove]]. A sanctuary of druids and clerics that worship the spirits of the trees. Arabella scoffed at all of this and believed it to all sound insane. Tree worshippers? It seemed like many people in this “community” had a few screws loose. Mikolus saw the expression on Arabella’s face and his suddenly became sullen. He told her he knew that face, the face of anger, the face of someone who has lost something important and may never get it back. He told her he once had a daughter named [[Lumeria]] who bore that same expression. Who felt the same anger that face represented, and ultimately was consumed by that anger. He said that through it all, all he could do was stay positive, for the world is a worse place without a simple smile. He had taught lumeria his magic out of love, to pass down everything his family had taught him, but in her unbridled rage, used it for hate. As unfortunate as it was he never gave up his teachings and knew that one day he would truly help someone conquer those feelings and even harness them. He saw something  in Arabella, though she had those feelings now, maybe that would not be the case forever. He offered to show his magic to Arabella but she was hesitant. He waved his hand and extended it to help her up off the bed. He got Arabella up and brought her out to show her the grove. Despite what she thought, it was quite beautiful. Beautiful wood carved buildings, big strong trees bearing what seemed to be the juiciest fruit imaginable. There were beds of beautiful flowers surrounding the area all of different colors. Birds and squirrels tending to their homes. Kids were frolicking and playing together while their parents coaxed them to be careful. Arabella had never seen a place as lovely as this before. Mick introduced her to his wife of many years, the village elder, [[Marania Village Elder]]. 
 
Unlike mikolus, Mara had a certain feeling to her, a certain calm feeling reminiscent of the village itself, that as very unlikely to Arabella’s personality, made her trust the woman almost immediately. They told her the history of the grove and of the two founders [[Lothmar Founder of Forborn Grove]] and [[Ceana Founder of Forborn Grove]]. And how their love shaped generations in the grove, and how mikolus and Mara feel that passing down that love preserves generations. Arabella thought for a little while and agreed to learn from mikolus. She knew that facing castion one day would bring her unfathomable anger, and truthfully that may not ever change, but she felt it couldn’t hurt to try to use it to her advantage, lest she lose her mind and be rash. They taught her something called meditation, a way of clearing your mind and ridding yourself of your muddled thoughts. Some days Arabella felt quite calm, some days the hatred swelled. They taught her to heal the body, and influence the mind.
 
They taught her to use the elements to her advantage, use the flowers, and the grass, for everything around her could be a weapon. A feeling in the back of her mind told her that despite the way they are teaching her to keep control of herself, one day these would become incredibly convenient in the conquering of her goal. She warmed up to the people of the village over the few years she was training, she even cared for mikolus and his wife, in a somewhat small manner, they almost felt like a family to her. But she knew that this could not last forever, for she needed answers, she needed to know why he did what he did, where the rest of them are and if they’re all safe. She could not remain complacent. She told mikolus and Mara that her goal was only beginning and that she was grateful for the lessons they taught her. She told them that she may see them again, and if she doesn’t, for them to take care of themselves, for after a long time by herself, Arabella had found people who matter to her. 

Mikolus told her to never lose sight of herself, for there are people out there who will truly care for you if you just give them a chance. As Arabella left she hoped what he said was true, for with the path she is taking, she may need all the help she can get.
