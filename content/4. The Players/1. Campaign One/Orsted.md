## Backstory:
%%

Orsted was raised by [Zalbanth the swift,](app://obsidian.md/Zalbanth%20the%20swift,) a copper dragon who took him in as a baby. Zalbanth is aware of Orsted's lineage but has not told him. Zalbanth told Orsted that he was found among the wreckage of a group of travelers who were seemingly attacked by monsters, his parents being seemingly killed. This is a lie of course, how Zalbanth found Orsted or why he raised the boy is known only to him. Zalbanth himself is a wise yet mischievous dragon. 

He loves playing pranks and telling jokes and his teachings were rarely ever straightforward, this attitude rubbed off on Orsted a significant amount. Zalbanth was around 36 when he found Orsted and is now 55, he never liked to talk about his past, always opting to change the subject if it were to come up. He taught Orsted to read and write and trained him how to fight. Orsted is naturally impulsive and quick to emotion, but Zalbanth taught him to calm and focus himself, though he still struggles with it a good deal. Overall he is a caring father, maybe a little aloof but doting in his own way. He's well aware that Orsted's lineage will make him a target, but he also knows that he won't be around to protect him forever. The best he could do was prepare him to make it on his own. Much of Orsted's training was Zalbanth cleverly teaching him to control his draconic blood without letting him know about said bloodline.

He framed it as a martial art style called Dragon Breathing. Using various breathing techniques he can mimic the power of dragons, resulting in elemental attacks, breath weapons and even claws. Of course these breathing techniques are more to keep Orsted's blood in check, holding back his more draconic features and temperaments. Orsted still believes that these techniques could be learned by anyone, not that he'd be a great teacher either way. Apart from fighting Zalbanth taught Orsted a decent school level education. Reading, writing, math, some history, and of course knowledge on dragons. After Orsted turned 19 he grew restless, wanting to go explore the world that he had been secluded away from and Zalbanth could no longer deny him. Before leaving he warned Orsted to not tell others that he was raised by a dragon, to say his father was a normal human hermit as it could put him in danger. And with that Orsted set out to see the world and find adventure.

Orsted and Zalbanth would go down to a village by the name of [Hexadale](app://obsidian.md/Hexadale) at the base of the mountain every few months to trade for supplies they couldn't get on the mountain (usually booze). Zalbanth was friends with the local blacksmith [Allan Silverhand](app://obsidian.md/Allan%20Silverhand). Allan is the only human that knows about Zalbanth's true identity and his past, the two of them go back far. Allan has a daughter named Lilly who is Orsted's age, so the two grew up as friends. There weren't any other kids in the village so she always looked forward to Zalbanth and Orsted's visits to cure her boredom. [Lilly's](app://obsidian.md/Lilly's) mother had died from the [Crimson Plague](app://obsidian.md/Crimson%20Plague) that swept through hexadale not long after she was born, so with the lack of female influence growing up ended up being quite the tomboy. She developed an interest in her father's work and started learning his craft at a young age. 

One time while they were visiting the village, Allan and Zalbanth were having a drink at the bar when some passing bandits came through. They entered the bar and decided to pick a fight with Zalbanth taunting and threatening him for money. Zalbanth calmly handed over his coin bag and asked them to leave. Annoyed, the bandits take the coin, pour the rest of Zalbanth's drink on his head and leave, Zalbanth laughs this encounter off. Orsted seeing this is furious that Zalbanth just let the bandits do that without fighting back, to which Zalbanth says that some things aren't worth coming to violence over. This still doesn't sit well with the 10 year old Orsted who sneaks out to give those bandits a piece of his mind, dragging Lilly along with him. 

As you would expect bandits don't take getting yelled at by some brat well. They rough up Orsted and grab Lilly, debating on which they should kill first. That's when Zalbanth and Allan showed up. Zalbanth warns the bandits that while he may be able to laugh off a spilled drink, if they bring harm to either of the children they're dead men. One of the bandits raises his sword at Zalbanth, who chastises that they shouldn't raise a sword to someone unless they're prepared to lose their head. This bandit proceeds to lose his head to Allan's sword. After Allan finishes off the bandits and makes sure the kids are unharmed, Zalbanth admonishes Orsted for his rash actions, not only for putting himself in danger but also Lilly. A few insults and a spilled drink are nothing to throw your life away for. Pride is dangerous, especially for Orsted.

Orsted’s relationship with Allan was like that of an uncle. Allan taught Orsted how to fight with a sword, as he was much better with a sword than Zalbanth. He also taught him a bit of smithing and how to upkeep weapons. Allan was much more serious and straightforward compared to Zalbanth, which suited Orsted’s own straightforwardness. Orsted was never able to beat Allan while sparring though. When they weren’t training Orsted and Zalbanth would join them for meals and Allan And Zalbanth would often go to the local tavern and drink. Usually Orsted and Lilly would leave the lame adults and go cause trouble somewhere. Overall Allan is a very stoic man with probably just as many secrets as Zalbanth, not that Orsted has given that any thought.

Lilly and Orsted were trouble makers as kids. Lilly always found her stoic father to be a bit boring so she would always look forward to the excitement Orsted and Zalbanth would bring whenever they came. They would usually run around town pulling pranks on people, things like balancing a bucket of water on top of an open door or placing a trip rope in front of a mud puddle. Of course people would get angry and complain to Allan and Zalbanth, to which Allan would always be very upset while Zalbanth was more “kids will be kids” about it (after all he taught them a number of their pranks). They would also often explore some of the small ruins around hexadale. When Allan began training Orsted smithing Lilly got very jealous and ended up getting into a fight with Orsted, after which Orsted begged Allan to teach Lilly as well so she wouldn’t hate him. Allan didn’t want Lilly doing his work due to how dangerous it could be, so it took some convincing but eventually he relented. Unfortunately, his fears would be validated later when Lilly would badly burn part of her face where her left eye is, she now wears an eyepatch over said eye. Orsted has always blamed himself for that injury. Orsted and Zalbanth were usually in town for the [Harvest Festival](app://obsidian.md/Harvest%20Festival), the Fair, and the Hexadale Fire, so Orsted and Lilly would always walk around together during these events. Many of the townsfolk saw the two as an item, though Orsted was oblivious to this. As they grew older Orsted began to notice Lilly more as a girl, though with his nonexistent sexual education didn’t really understand his feelings for her, and he was never really around for a long enough time to figure those feelings out. Before Orsted left on his journey, Lilly gave him the sword he uses, which was forged by her. It’s very important to him.
