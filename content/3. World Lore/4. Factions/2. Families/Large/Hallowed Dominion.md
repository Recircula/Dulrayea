The group's emphasis on defense is a testament to their leaders' dedication to protecting those they aid.
>> - **Natural Sanctuaries:** Inspired by Eldorin Greenmantle's knowledge of hidden natural sanctuaries, the Hallowed Dominion maintains these locations as vital refuges. Ariala, the botanist, specializes in identifying and utilizing the natural resources found in these sanctuaries. Fenosa, the environmental scout, surveys the land for potential hiding spots and safe havens. These sanctuaries provide temporary respite for the fleeing families and serve as the group's secret strongholds, hidden away from prying eyes.
>> - **Secure Communication:** Zephyra Starweaver's expertise in secure communication channels is the backbone of the group's coordination.

>> [!abstract|text-Center bg-c-gray]- Tactics
>> - **Discreet and Calculated:** Their every move is a study in discretion, understanding the delicate balance of power within Rosenwheel's political landscape. Their actions are shadows, their presence a whisper, ensuring that powerful families like the Galehearts, Delacterease, Stavros, and Buckstones remain oblivious to their true intentions.
>> - **Master of Subterfuge:** Within Rosenwheel, they are phantoms, blending seamlessly into the fabric of the city. Whether adopting the guise of a humble merchant, a wandering bard, or a faceless commoner, they weave identities that allow them to move unnoticed, their actions leaving ripples too subtle to draw attention.
>> - **Tactful Avoidance of Conflict:** Faced with the might of Rosenwheel's powerful families, they choose their battles with care. They know that a direct confrontation could spell disaster, not just for their mission but for the very people they strive to protect. Their approach is one of strategic timing, acting in moments of opportunity when their adversaries are looking elsewhere.
>> - **Intelligence and Information Control:** Information is their currency, and they spend it wisely. They keep a vigilant eye on the activities and plans of the major houses, using this intelligence to stay one step ahead. They understand the power of misinformation and use it to mislead and confound their adversaries, turning the enemy's strength against them.
>> - **Strategic Relocation and Mobility:** Their base of operations is a concept, not a location. They are a mobile force, using safe houses and temporary shelters, ensuring they are always elusive, always out of reach of those who might seek to unearth their secrets.
>> - **Community Integration:** They have woven themselves into the fabric of Rosenwheel, building a network of allies among its people. These alliances, ranging from sympathetic locals to disenchanted members of lower families, provide them with additional resources and information, allowing them to operate effectively while maintaining a veil of secrecy.

>> - **Meticulous Planning:** Their operations are masterpieces of planning, every detail considered, every risk weighed. They plan for every eventuality, their contingencies as numerous as the stars, ensuring they can adapt and respond to any challenge without drawing the spotlight upon themselves.
>> - **Intellectual Cat-and-Mouse with Rhys Galeheart:** The battle of wits against Rhys Galeheart and his Disciples of Shadow is a constant, high-stakes game. They weave a tapestry of deception, their successes rare jewels hard-earned through cunning and innovation. Rhys, a formidable adversary, often uncovers their schemes, forcing them into an endless cycle of adaptation.
>> - **Engagements with Larger and Smaller Families:** In their dealings with the larger and smaller families of Rosenwheel, they tread a fine line between diplomacy and deception. With the smaller families, they are diplomats and manipulators, ensuring these lesser powers do not impede their mission. Against the larger houses, they are ghosts, their presence a rumor, a myth, avoiding direct confrontations and using their perceived insignificance to their advantage.
