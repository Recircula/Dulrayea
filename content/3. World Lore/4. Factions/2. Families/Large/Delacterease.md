>> 1. **Potion Crafting and Alchemy:** Delacterease members are avid potion crafters and alchemists, with a focus on concoctions that enhance their dark magic and strengthen their elven physiology. They believe in the purity of their alchemical creations and see them as a testament to the superiority of elven intellect.    
>> 2. **Purity:** The concept of purity is central to Delacterease. They obsessively seek to maintain the purity of their bloodline and consider any mixing with other races as a dilution of their heritage. Rituals that purify and strengthen their elven essence are highly revered. 
>> 3. **Artistic Cruelty:** Acts of cruelty are not just about causing pain but inflicting it with a perverse elegance. The more refined and artistic the suffering, the greater the satisfaction for the sadistic members, with a particular focus on the suffering of non-elven races. This artistic cruelty is a manifestation of their belief in the aesthetic superiority of their bloodline.
>>  
>> **Dislikes** - 
>> 1. **Hope:** Delacterease despises any glimmer of hope, crushing it with ruthless efficiency.

>> 3. **Corrupted Souls:** The guild revels in the corruption of souls, viewing it as a necessary step toward unlocking the true potential of their dark powers. They actively seek out and manipulate the essence of other beings, twisting it into a malevolent force that serves their elven and Eladrin supremacist agenda. The corrupted souls are seen as trophies of their conquest over the impurity of the world.

Adventures, Heroes, and all people across of Dulrayea have use this potion to heal there wounds. The House of Delacterease have created a vast empire of mass producing potions of all sorts that can heal, mend, surge, and enhance the user. Now, who was the creator of this massive House? Well, that would be [[Vameer Delacterease]]. He was the founder and the creator of the simple health potion back in 23,650 in the Era named [[The War of Memories]].
>>   
>>   He created the first ever Health potion when his youngest son Luthin was stabbed in the chest by a demons blade when they where investigating sightings of a vile creature from the northern lands. It cursed his son with a vile disease  that made his skin start to decay and his blood curdle into black tar.  Vameer did not know what to do, he was not a magic caster but, a simple alchemist. Vameer, went to the high clerics of [[Shayu, The City of The Falling Stars]], begged and plead for them to heal his son wounds. Vameer, even offered his own life so that his son can live.  The clerics looked at him with pity and disgrace of a High Noble elf like him pleading for life. They abandoned him and his son, They let his son body burn and be eaten alive by a disease that they the clerics of [[Wood Elves]] could simply stop. Vameer, with no hope left started to work on a potion that potentially could heal his son or kill him. He was gifted with foresight and alchemical knowledge from his fathers. With the blood of *(redacted)*, the grains of *(redacted)*, and the essence of *(redacted)* he slowly poured the potion into the wound. Vameer noticed that the wounds started to heal quickly from the potion. It restored the flesh and bone that the disease started to strip away. Vameer, delighted to see his son not stricken by a disease any longer saw something else, the potential of this potion. Vameer, started to mass produce these potions to help the solider of the great war that was coming. Vameer, finally creating the potion named "Tel' emphasis quesst Ath faen" which translated from elvish to common is "The Nectar Of Life" which is commonly known now as "The Health Potion" now. This potion Aided in the great war against orcs, demons, elves and man. He made this potions so that no son or daughter can be left in the darkness like his son was.

Vameer, with his two sons and wife slowly started to gain a reputation amongst travelers, merchants, and even small Cities of there potions that could heal, fix, and help the common folk. The people across Dulrayea started to recognize the true potential of Vameer alchemical craftsmanship. With time Vameer, reputation started to grow and his small home became an empire. Vameer, saw the rise of [[Rosen Wheel]] and was one of the great founders of it. He made peace with the other families.
>>    
>>    But, Vameer sons [[Luthin Delacterease]] and [[Folt Delacterease]] where killed by members of the [[Buckstones]]. There bodies where stringed up in the streets and paraded amongst the citizens and family members of the Buckstones like animals. Vameer, seeing his sons bodies being put on display like this caused his heart to feed of of a disease that he once put out. He crept back into his heart and mind and felt the same fear he once did before. He knew he had the will of gods under his hands. He knew he had the will to uncreate life and destroy cities. Vameer, sough out revenge. He meet with the sorceress of [[Voth'Dren]] and the witches of the eastern deserts. When he came back he was changed. He was burden with death.

>>    
>>    For centuries after the death of his sons. Vameer sought out vengeance in different ways. He poisoned the potions, he strung armed cities to let the people suffer,  he placed curses and hexes on the dead, he made illusions and deals with the darkness. But, Soon after of years of tormenting the families of Rosen Wheel, he disappeared. No one has seen or found or even heard of where Vameer went. It has been rumored that on the [[Night Of Dreams]]  a loud scream came from The Delacterease house and a glowing white light engulfed the house.

She has started to take the same steps but not the same paths as her great, great, great grandfather did. She has started to learn the ways of alchemy and become the new Head Alchemist of Dulrayea like her ancestor was before." - [[Shoda Delacterease]]
