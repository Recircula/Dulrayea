## Abilities

###### The Lotus Dance
_5th level ability_
*Casting Time*: **1 action**
*Duration*: **1 Minute**
*Range*: **25ft or 55ft**

**Natural Evasion:** While in The Lotus Dance, The Player gains heightened agility and reflexes. They have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against spells and effects that target them directly. Additionally, if the Druid is subjected to an effect that allows them to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, they instead take no damage on a successful save.

**Fluid Movement:** The Druid’s movements become ethereal and graceful, allowing them to effortlessly navigate through obstacles and difficult terrain. While in The Lotus Dance, the Druid ignores difficult terrain and can move through non-magical plants and undergrowth without penalty to their speed. They also gain a climbing speed equal to their normal walking speed.  

**Blossoming Aura:** The Druid emanates an aura of natural vitality while in The Lotus Dance. As a bonus action, the Druid can choose up to three creatures within 30 feet to benefit from their aura. These creatures gain temporary hit points equal to the Druid’s level plus their Wisdom modifier. The temporary hit points last until depleted or until the Druid uses this ability again.  


##### Passive:
If you use this ability in a forest your abilities will grow further boosting the range to 60-95ft.

**Savior**: When using the lotus dance and allies become the target of spells. You can release a bloom of vines to move an ally out of the way of a spell. You must have a reaction readied and see the target spell coming to trigger said passive.
