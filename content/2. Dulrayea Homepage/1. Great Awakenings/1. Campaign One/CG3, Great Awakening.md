# **Abilities**

### _Level 5_ **Vengeance:**
*****Hot Swap: Twice Per Long Day** At 5th level, the Gunslinger unlocks the Hot Swap maneuver, a tactical technique that showcases their prowess in firearm manipulation and adaptability in combat. This maneuver allows the Gunslinger to seamlessly switch to another firearm in their possession, infusing it with the volatile essence of Hot Shot damage. Upon executing the Hot Swap, the newly selected gun deals Hot Shot damage and gains Advantage against the targeted enemy, catching them off guard with the sudden change in firepower.

_Recharge:_ The Hot Swap ability recharges every day at dawn, allowing the Gunslinger to utilize it twice per long day.

_Advancement in Hot Swap:_ As the Gunslinger progresses in level, their mastery of the Hot Swap maneuver expands, enabling them to execute more frequent firearm exchanges:

- **Level 10th:** With access to two firearms, the Gunslinger can perform Hot Swap four times per long day.
- **Level 15th:** Equipped with three guns, the Gunslinger executes Hot Swap six times per long day.
- **Level 17th:** Armed with four firearms, the Gunslinger orchestrates Hot Swap eight times per long day.
- **Level 20th:** Possessing five guns, the Gunslinger executes Hot Swap ten times per long day, solidifying their reputation as a master tactician on the battlefield and a force to be reckoned with in any conflict.

**Passive:** In addition to their formidable offensive capabilities, the Gunslinger gains a passive ability that activates when allies are incapacitated, whether due to unconsciousness or death. In these dire circumstances, the Gunslinger's resolve intensifies, fueling their righteous fury and granting them additional damage against the perpetrator as they seek retribution for their fallen comrades. This innate sense of justice serves as a driving force, propelling the Gunslinger to retaliate with unbridled ferocity against those who dare to harm their allies.

****: Battlefield Aid (Once Per Long Rest):** As the Gunslinger ascends to higher levels, they further refine Battlefield Aid, solidifying their role as a battlefield savior and protector. During Tactical Support near an incapacitated ally, the Gunslinger channels potent energy to turn the tide of battle. If the ally is unconscious, the Gunslinger's restorative powers surge, healing them for the following amounts:

| Level | Healing Dice |
| ----- | :----------: |
| 5th   |     3d6      |
| 10th  |     4d6      |
| 15th  |     5d6      |
| 17th  |     6d6      |
| 20th  |     7d6      |

Additionally, if the ally succumbs to the fight, the Gunslinger's righteous fury manifests, unleashing an additional 3d6 Hot Shot damage upon their enemies, instigating chaos and disarray among their ranks. Moreover, the Gunslinger's unwavering presence instills confidence in allies, granting them temporary hit points equal to double their Intelligence modifier + proficiency bonus. This bolstered ability can be activated once per long rest, underlining its critical importance as a decisive intervention in dire circumstances.

**New Mechanics and Rules:**
1. **Chain Reaction (Rule):** Upon successfully landing a critical hit with Hot Shot damage, the Gunslinger triggers a Chain Reaction, allowing them to immediately perform Tactical Support with another ally as a reaction. This grants the ally the benefits of Hot Shot damage and Advantage on their next attack.
2. **Explosive Rounds (Rule and Spell):** The Gunslinger can expend additional ammunition and cast the spell "Fireball" using a firearm loaded with Explosive Rounds. This causes the firearm to unleash a powerful explosion upon impact, dealing 8d6 fire damage to all creatures within a 20-foot radius of the target.
3. **Overclocked Arsenal (Rule and Mechanics):** By overclocking their firearms, the Gunslinger can temporarily increase their firing rate and damage output. However, after using this ability, the Gunslinger must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15) or suffer 2d6 fire damage from the overheated weapons. Additionally, the firearms become jammed and require a successful Dexterity check (DC 15) to repair.

### _Level 10_ The Pass:
